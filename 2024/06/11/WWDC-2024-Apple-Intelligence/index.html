To tell you more, here&#x27;s Haley.</span><br><span class="line">7:40</span><br><span class="line">Haley Allen: visionOS 2 is a great release with some big updates. Let&#x27;s start with Photos.</span><br><span class="line">7:46</span><br><span class="line">Spatial computing has reinvented how you view your photos. There&#x27;s nothing like seeing them life-sized with incredible fidelity.</span><br><span class="line">7:53</span><br><span class="line">Spatial photos are even more powerful, bringing life and realism to your favorite moments with family and friends.</span><br><span class="line">8:00</span><br><span class="line">It&#x27;s incredibly moving to step back into a treasured memory, and the rich visual depth of spatial photos makes this possible.</span><br><span class="line">8:08</span><br><span class="line">Now, visionOS 2 lets you do something truly amazing with the photos already in your library.</span><br><span class="line">8:14</span><br><span class="line">With just the tap of a button, advanced machine learning derives both a left and right eye view</span><br><span class="line">8:20</span><br><span class="line">from your beautiful 2D image, creating a spatial photo with natural depth that looks stunning on Vision Pro.</span><br><span class="line">8:27</span><br><span class="line">It&#x27;s so magical to reach into the past and bring your most cherished photos into the future.</span><br><span class="line">8:33</span><br><span class="line">And now, you can experience all your panoramas and spatial photos and videos together with the people you love using SharePlay in the Photos app.</span><br><span class="line">8:42</span><br><span class="line">With our new spatial Personas, it feels like they are sitting right next to you, even if they&#x27;re thousands of miles away.</span><br><span class="line">8:51</span><br><span class="line">People are amazed at how easy it is to navigate Vision Pro with just their eyes, hands, and voice.</span><br><span class="line">8:58</span><br><span class="line">And with visionOS 2, we&#x27;ve made it even easier. Now you can just hold your hand up and tap to open Home View.</span><br><span class="line">9:06</span><br><span class="line">Or flip your hand over to bring up time and battery level. And tap again to open Control Center, giving you quick access</span><br><span class="line">9:13</span><br><span class="line">to frequently used features like Notifications and Mac Virtual Display. People love Mac Virtual Display</span><br><span class="line">9:19</span><br><span class="line">because it lets them bring their Mac wirelessly into Vision Pro just by looking at it, giving them a large, private, and portable 4K display.</span><br><span class="line">9:27</span><br><span class="line">Later this year, it gets even better, with higher display resolution and size. And it can be expanded even further, into an ultra-wide display</span><br><span class="line">9:36</span><br><span class="line">that wraps around you, equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side. Your content stays sharp wherever you look</span><br><span class="line">9:43</span><br><span class="line">thanks to dynamic foveation performed on the Mac. Another great thing about Apple Vision Pro is how incredible it is to use on a plane,</span><br><span class="line">9:52</span><br><span class="line">letting you take a private movie theater wherever you go. With visionOS 2, we&#x27;re adding train support to Travel Mode,</span><br><span class="line">9:59</span><br><span class="line">so you can work privately on your long commute or catch up on your favorite shows on a massive screen.</span><br><span class="line">10:05</span><br><span class="line">These updates are going to make the Vision Pro experience even better. And now, back to Mike.</span><br><span class="line">10:15</span><br><span class="line">Mike: In addition to these great features, visionOS 2 also makes it even easier for developers to create</span><br><span class="line">10:21</span><br><span class="line">sophisticated spatial apps. There are many new frameworks and APIs for developers to explore,</span><br><span class="line">10:27</span><br><span class="line">like advanced volumetric APIs that allow even the most complex 3D apps to run side by side for the ultimate multitasking experience.</span><br><span class="line">10:36</span><br><span class="line">TabletopKit makes it possible for developers to quickly create apps that anchor to flat surfaces,</span><br><span class="line">10:42</span><br><span class="line">like manufacturing workstations or board and card games, and are great for use with spatial Personas on FaceTime.</span><br><span class="line">10:49</span><br><span class="line">And enterprise-specific APIs that will enable powerful use cases like surgical training in healthcare, equipment maintenance in manufacturing,</span><br><span class="line">10:58</span><br><span class="line">and beyond. These new APIs and frameworks will unlock exciting opportunities</span><br><span class="line">11:03</span><br><span class="line">for developers to create truly unique experiences. We&#x27;re also making it easier for people to create new spatial content</span><br><span class="line">11:11</span><br><span class="line">for Apple Vision Pro, like spatial video. We&#x27;ve made it so easy to capture spatial video anywhere</span><br><span class="line">11:17</span><br><span class="line">with iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.</span><br><span class="line">11:24</span><br><span class="line">It&#x27;s one of the best ways to relive meaningful moments in your life.</span><br><span class="line">11:30</span><br><span class="line">Spatial video can also be used by pro videographers to tell powerful brand, product, and creative stories.</span><br><span class="line">11:38</span><br><span class="line">To make creating and sharing spatial videos with commercial audiences easier, Canon will offer a brand-new spatial lens for their popular EOS R7 digital camera.</span><br><span class="line">11:49</span><br><span class="line">It can record gorgeous spatial video for Apple Vision Pro, even under the most challenging lighting conditions.</span><br><span class="line">11:56</span><br><span class="line">Spatial videos can then be edited in Final Cut Pro for Mac and shared and viewed in the new Vimeo app for visionOS.</span><br><span class="line">12:03</span><br><span class="line">This new professional workflow will be available this fall. Last year, we also introduced Apple Immersive Video,</span><br><span class="line">12:12</span><br><span class="line">a game-changing entertainment format created just for Vision Pro. Apple Immersive Videos are 180-degree, 8K recordings with Spatial Audio</span><br><span class="line">12:22</span><br><span class="line">that give you mind-blowing experiences with lifelike fidelity. It truly feels like you are there.</span><br><span class="line">12:31</span><br><span class="line">To enable creators to bring their own stories to life with Apple Immersive Video, we&#x27;ve partnered first</span><br><span class="line">12:37</span><br><span class="line">with Blackmagic Design, a leading innovator in creative video technology, to build a new production workflow consisting of Blackmagic cameras,</span><br><span class="line">12:46</span><br><span class="line">DaVinci Resolve Studio, and Apple Compressor. These will all be available to creators later this year.</span><br><span class="line">12:53</span><br><span class="line">And there&#x27;s new Apple Immersive Video content on the way, including a new extreme sports series with Red Bull,</span><br><span class="line">13:01</span><br><span class="line">reimagined experiences from the world&#x27;s biggest artists like The Weeknd,</span><br><span class="line">13:06</span><br><span class="line">and our first scripted Apple Immersive short film, &quot;Submerged,&quot; from Oscar-winning director Edward Berger.</span><br><span class="line">13:12</span><br><span class="line">These titles and more will be available on the TV app. So that&#x27;s what&#x27;s coming to Apple Vision Pro and visionOS.</span><br><span class="line">13:21</span><br><span class="line">visionOS 2 introduces a new way to turn your favorite photos into spatial photos,</span><br><span class="line">13:27</span><br><span class="line">new intuitive gestures, a big boost to productivity with Mac Virtual Display,</span><br><span class="line">13:32</span><br><span class="line">powerful new developer APIs, and so much more. Now, back to Tim.</span><br><span class="line">13:39</span><br><span class="line">Tim: As you can see, we&#x27;re continuing to push visionOS forward as well as providing</span><br><span class="line">13:45</span><br><span class="line">new content and capabilities for Apple Vision Pro. I&#x27;ve been hearing from people all over the world about their interest</span><br><span class="line">13:52</span><br><span class="line">in this incredible product. So I&#x27;m happy to announce we&#x27;re bringing Apple Vision Pro</span><br><span class="line">13:58</span><br><span class="line">to these eight countries next, starting with China, Japan, and Singapore on June 28.</span><br><span class="line">14:05</span><br><span class="line">And Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom on July 12.</span><br><span class="line">14:11</span><br><span class="line">Now, here&#x27;s Craig to tell you all about what&#x27;s coming in iOS. ♪ ♪</span><br><span class="line">iOS</span><br><span class="line">14:33</span><br><span class="line">Craig: iOS 18 is a big release that delivers more ways to customize your iPhone,</span><br><span class="line">14:38</span><br><span class="line">stay connected, and relive special moments. First, let&#x27;s talk about a set of features that give you exciting new ways</span><br><span class="line">14:47</span><br><span class="line">to personalize your iPhone further, starting with your Home Screen. You can already customize your Home Screen with your favorite wallpaper,</span><br><span class="line">14:54</span><br><span class="line">apps, and widgets, letting your personality shine through. And now, your app icons and widgets can add even more.</span><br><span class="line">15:04</span><br><span class="line">Let me show you. I have this photo I love as my wallpaper.</span><br><span class="line">15:09</span><br><span class="line">And now I can continue to enjoy it when I unlock my iPhone, because I can arrange my apps and widgets to frame it perfectly.</span><br><span class="line">15:17</span><br><span class="line">I can select them all and easily place them along the bottom, right above the Dock for easy access,</span><br><span class="line">15:25</span><br><span class="line">or even off to the side. And check this out!</span><br><span class="line">15:30</span><br><span class="line">We have an awesome new look for app icons when we go into Dark Mode. Let&#x27;s turn it on.</span><br><span class="line">15:38</span><br><span class="line">Isn&#x27;t that cool? Now, in addition to this new dark look, there are even more new ways to adjust how they look.</span><br><span class="line">15:46</span><br><span class="line">I can bring up a new customization sheet, and now I can tint them all with color.</span><br><span class="line">15:54</span><br><span class="line">iOS suggests a tint color that complements my wallpaper. Or I can select any other color I want.</span><br><span class="line">16:06</span><br><span class="line">Now they really pop. It&#x27;s so easy to create just the right look.</span><br><span class="line">16:12</span><br><span class="line">Whether you prefer the classic look, or want to go dark, or style with color, there are so many possibilities to make your Home Screen truly your own.</span><br><span class="line">16:21</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re also bringing new levels of customization and capability to Control Center,</span><br><span class="line">16:27</span><br><span class="line">helping you access many of the things you do every day even faster. Let&#x27;s take a look.</span><br><span class="line">16:33</span><br><span class="line">When I swipe from the top-right corner, I can see Control Center, with all my controls organized in one place.</span><br><span class="line">16:41</span><br><span class="line">And now Control Center isn&#x27;t limited to just the controls you see here. I can swipe to multiple new groups of controls,</span><br><span class="line">16:48</span><br><span class="line">like for Media Playback. You can see how beautiful this looks. And here are my Home Controls.</span><br><span class="line">16:55</span><br><span class="line">It&#x27;s so useful to have everything arranged for me like this. Oh, that shouldn&#x27;t be open. Let me close the garage.</span><br><span class="line">17:04</span><br><span class="line">And what&#x27;s really great is, I can get to any one of these groups with a single, continuous swipe.</span><br><span class="line">17:11</span><br><span class="line">I can get straight to my Home Controls, for instance, or right back up to the top.</span><br><span class="line">17:17</span><br><span class="line">To add more controls, I can open up the new Controls Gallery,</span><br><span class="line">17:22</span><br><span class="line">where I have so many options to choose from. We wanted to make Control Center more extensible than ever.</span><br><span class="line">17:28</span><br><span class="line">So now, developers can include controls from their apps as well! Like this one from Ford.</span><br><span class="line">17:35</span><br><span class="line">Let&#x27;s add that in. I can adjust how my controls are laid out and resize them too.</span><br><span class="line">17:43</span><br><span class="line">Now I can cool down the car just like that.</span><br><span class="line">17:49</span><br><span class="line">So that&#x27;s the new Control Center! To enable new controls in Control Center, we have a new Controls API for developers.</span><br><span class="line">17:57</span><br><span class="line">And that&#x27;s not all. These new controls are also available from the Lock Screen, so you can swap the camera and flashlight for different controls,</span><br><span class="line">18:05</span><br><span class="line">like taking a note when an idea strikes, or quickly capturing the moment for your Snapchat.</span><br><span class="line">18:11</span><br><span class="line">And you can even use the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro to invoke these new controls.</span><br><span class="line">18:18</span><br><span class="line">Another key part of personalizing iOS is about keeping you in control of your privacy.</span><br><span class="line">18:25</span><br><span class="line">And iOS 18 gives you even more ways to control who can see your apps, how you share your contacts, and how you connect to accessories.</span><br><span class="line">18:34</span><br><span class="line">Let&#x27;s start with apps. Sometimes we hand our device to someone so they can look at a photo or play a game,</span><br><span class="line">18:42</span><br><span class="line">but we want peace of mind that they can&#x27;t get into sensitive areas of our phone. So this year, we&#x27;re giving you a new way to protect sensitive apps</span><br><span class="line">18:50</span><br><span class="line">and the information inside them, by letting you lock an app. When you choose to lock an app, if someone else tries to tap it,</span><br><span class="line">18:58</span><br><span class="line">they will be required to authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode.</span><br><span class="line">19:03</span><br><span class="line">And information from inside the app won&#x27;t appear in other places across the system, like in search and notifications,</span><br><span class="line">19:11</span><br><span class="line">so others won&#x27;t inadvertently see sensitive information. There may also be occasions when you want to hide an app</span><br><span class="line">19:17</span><br><span class="line">that you don&#x27;t want others to know is installed on your device. For example, say you use a professional grade spatial capture app</span><br><span class="line">19:25</span><br><span class="line">to track your different hairstyles. I mean, that&#x27;s just good science, right? Well, anyway, say you use this app, but you don&#x27;t want anyone else to know.</span><br><span class="line">19:34</span><br><span class="line">Well, now you can hide it and put it in a new hidden apps folder that&#x27;s locked.</span><br><span class="line">19:41</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re also adding new ways to control how you share information with apps, starting with contacts.</span><br><span class="line">19:47</span><br><span class="line">Today, when you give an app access to your contacts, it can learn about all the people you&#x27;ve added over time.</span><br><span class="line">19:53</span><br><span class="line">In iOS 18, we&#x27;re putting you in control by letting you decide which contacts an app can see.</span><br><span class="line">20:00</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re also putting you in control when you pair accessories. An app may ask for Bluetooth and local network access</span><br><span class="line">20:08</span><br><span class="line">but also gain visibility to all the other devices on your network, from your computers and TVs</span><br><span class="line">20:14</span><br><span class="line">to your door locks and blood pressure monitor. Now, developers can offer you an intuitive new way to pair your accessories</span><br><span class="line">20:21</span><br><span class="line">that keeps your devices private and makes pairing seamless. Next up, we have big enhancements to the apps we use to stay connected,</span><br><span class="line">20:30</span><br><span class="line">starting with Messages. To tell you more, here&#x27;s Ronak.</span><br><span class="line">20:37</span><br><span class="line">Ronak Shah: Messages is central to how we communicate with the most important people in our lives, so in iOS 18, we&#x27;re giving you all-new ways</span><br><span class="line">20:45</span><br><span class="line">to express yourself and stay connected. Let&#x27;s start with Tapbacks.</span><br><span class="line">20:51</span><br><span class="line">Tapbacks are one of the most popular ways to express yourself in Messages. And people love them.</span><br><span class="line">20:57</span><br><span class="line">This is a huge year for Tapbacks. We&#x27;ve not only redesigned your favorites.</span><br><span class="line">21:02</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re now giving you limitless ways to express yourself by letting you Tapback with any emoji or sticker.</span><br><span class="line">21:08</span><br><span class="line">Next, we&#x27;re bringing one of your most requested features to Messages. When you don&#x27;t want to forget to send that friendly reminder</span><br><span class="line">21:16</span><br><span class="line">or birthday text in the morning, you can schedule your message to Send Later.</span><br><span class="line">21:21</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re also giving you more ways to express your tone with text formatting. Bold, italicize, underline, or strike through any text.</span><br><span class="line">21:30</span><br><span class="line">And when formatting is not enough, we&#x27;re introducing a new way to visually amplify your messages with text effects!</span><br><span class="line">21:36</span><br><span class="line">Whether you want to emphasize some major news, bring your emoji to life, or you&#x27;re just blown away by a stunning photo,</span><br><span class="line">21:44</span><br><span class="line">you can express yourself in all-new ways with text effects. Some words and phrases automatically surface a suggestion,</span><br><span class="line">21:52</span><br><span class="line">so you can quickly select one and send it. And you can also add one of the many new effects to any text.</span><br><span class="line">22:02</span><br><span class="line">Last, there&#x27;s a new way to stay connected whenever you don&#x27;t have Wi-Fi or cellular service.</span><br><span class="line">22:08</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re using the same groundbreaking technology that gave us Emergency SOS via satellite to bring you Messages via satellite.</span><br><span class="line">22:16</span><br><span class="line">Now you can use the satellite capabilities on iPhone 14 and later to connect to satellites hundreds of miles above the Earth</span><br><span class="line">22:23</span><br><span class="line">to text your friends and family when you&#x27;re off the grid all right from the Messages app. Once you&#x27;ve connected, you&#x27;ll be able to use key iMessage features</span><br><span class="line">22:31</span><br><span class="line">like sending and receiving messages, emoji, and Tapbacks. Because iMessage was built to protect your privacy,</span><br><span class="line">22:38</span><br><span class="line">iMessages sent over satellite are end-to-end encrypted. And if you need to text people not on iMessage,</span><br><span class="line">22:45</span><br><span class="line">we&#x27;re supporting SMS messaging via satellite too. Now, let&#x27;s talk about another app we use to communicate, Mail.</span><br><span class="line">22:54</span><br><span class="line">This year, we&#x27;re giving you a new way to stay in control and manage incoming email with on-device categorization</span><br><span class="line">23:00</span><br><span class="line">that organizes your messages and helps you stay up to date across all of your accounts.</span><br><span class="line">23:06</span><br><span class="line">The Primary category enables you to focus on what matters most-- emails from people you know and time-sensitive messages.</span><br><span class="line">23:14</span><br><span class="line">The rest of your email will be organized into new categories like Transactions, for receipts and order confirmations,</span><br><span class="line">23:20</span><br><span class="line">Updates, for newsletters and social media notices, and Promotions, for marketing and sales messages.</span><br><span class="line">23:26</span><br><span class="line">And these categories do more than just sort your email. We&#x27;ve also created an elegant new digest view</span><br><span class="line">23:32</span><br><span class="line">that pulls together all the relevant emails you&#x27;ve received from a business to make interacting with these messages even easier.</span><br><span class="line">23:39</span><br><span class="line">For instance, it can bring together all of your flight information from United, so you can get to it in one place.</span><br><span class="line">23:45</span><br><span class="line">You can quickly scan snippets of each message to see what&#x27;s new and explore what you&#x27;re interested in.</span><br><span class="line">23:50</span><br><span class="line">If you want a sender to appear in another category, you can recategorize them with just a few taps.</span><br><span class="line">23:56</span><br><span class="line">Archiving or deleting all of the messages from a business is just as easy. And of course, you can always see all of your emails in one place.</span><br><span class="line">24:06</span><br><span class="line">Categorization will be available later this year. And now, back to Craig.</span><br><span class="line">24:13</span><br><span class="line">Craig: iOS 18 also includes some great updates to apps and features you use every day.</span><br><span class="line">24:19</span><br><span class="line">Let&#x27;s walk through a few of them, starting with Maps. Maps delivers new topographic maps</span><br><span class="line">24:25</span><br><span class="line">with detailed trail networks and hiking routes, including all 63 U.S. national parks,</span><br><span class="line">24:31</span><br><span class="line">that can be saved to your phone and accessed offline with turn-by-turn voice guidance and the ability to create your own hikes.</span><br><span class="line">24:39</span><br><span class="line">Next, Wallet. Continuing on our journey to replace your physical wallet,</span><br><span class="line">24:44</span><br><span class="line">we&#x27;re introducing Tap to Cash, a quick and private way to exchange Apple Cash</span><br><span class="line">24:50</span><br><span class="line">without sharing phone numbers or email addresses. With Tap to Cash, you can pay someone back for dinner</span><br><span class="line">24:56</span><br><span class="line">just by holding your phones together. We&#x27;re adding two new ways to pay with Apple Pay Online,</span><br><span class="line">25:02</span><br><span class="line">giving customers around the world the ability to redeem rewards and access installments from their banks and card providers.</span><br><span class="line">25:08</span><br><span class="line">And event tickets are getting a beautiful new design and new features, including an all-new event guide</span><br><span class="line">25:16</span><br><span class="line">combining helpful information about the venue, with smart recommendations from your favorite Apple apps.</span><br><span class="line">25:22</span><br><span class="line">We also have updates to Journal that let you log your state of mind and help you keep track of your goals with an insights view</span><br><span class="line">25:30</span><br><span class="line">that shows your writing streaks, a calendar, and other fun stats. And you can now use Search to quickly find the past entries you&#x27;re looking for.</span><br><span class="line">25:40</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re also excited to announce an update with great improvements for gamers.</span><br><span class="line">25:45</span><br><span class="line">Game Mode is coming to iPhone, enabling a more immersive experience with games like &quot;Zenless Zone Zero.&quot;</span><br><span class="line">25:52</span><br><span class="line">Just like on Mac, Game Mode minimizes background activity to sustain the highest frame rates, especially during long play sessions,</span><br><span class="line">26:01</span><br><span class="line">and it dramatically improves responsiveness with AirPods and wireless game controllers.</span><br><span class="line">26:06</span><br><span class="line">Finally, we have some big news for an app where we relive our most precious memories and adventures, Photos.</span><br><span class="line">26:15</span><br><span class="line">Our photo libraries contain all of the big and small moments in our lives. But as we capture so much, and our libraries grow bigger by the day,</span><br><span class="line">26:24</span><br><span class="line">how can we keep it all organized so we can appreciate all of those moments and easily get to the good stuff?</span><br><span class="line">26:30</span><br><span class="line">iOS 18 brings the biggest redesign ever to the Photos app.</span><br><span class="line">26:36</span><br><span class="line">To tell us more about the all-new design, here&#x27;s Chelsea.</span><br><span class="line">26:42</span><br><span class="line">Chelsea Burnette: The new Photos app keeps your library organized and makes it super easy to find photos fast,</span><br><span class="line">26:47</span><br><span class="line">so you can spend less time searching and more time enjoying your memories. Let me show you.</span><br><span class="line">26:53</span><br><span class="line">This new design is gorgeous, feels familiar, and it puts everything you want right at your fingertips.</span><br><span class="line">26:59</span><br><span class="line">The app has been unified into a single view, with the photo grid at the top, and your library organized by theme below.</span><br><span class="line">27:07</span><br><span class="line">The photo grid is a great place to view your entire library. When you want to quickly jump back to specific dates,</span><br><span class="line">27:14</span><br><span class="line">you can use Months and Years views at the bottom. I have a lot in my library, so it&#x27;s great that this filter button</span><br><span class="line">27:21</span><br><span class="line">lets me quickly narrow it down to specific types of content. And now I can even filter out screenshots, to enjoy my photos clutter-free.</span><br><span class="line">27:30</span><br><span class="line">We know that it can be tough to keep our ever-growing libraries organized, so we&#x27;ve built on the amazing intelligence in the Photos app</span><br><span class="line">27:38</span><br><span class="line">and created a space below the grid that makes it easy to access the photos you care about most.</span><br><span class="line">27:44</span><br><span class="line">We call these Collections. With Collections, you can browse by topics like time, people, my favorite memories,</span><br><span class="line">27:54</span><br><span class="line">new ones like Trips, and more. Let&#x27;s go back and check out Recent Days.</span><br><span class="line">27:59</span><br><span class="line">Recent Days organizes photos by each day with clutter, like receipts, filtered out.</span><br><span class="line">28:05</span><br><span class="line">Here are my photos from earlier today. You&#x27;ll see an autoplaying view of all the photos at the top.</span><br><span class="line">28:11</span><br><span class="line">I can swipe between days like this to see my hike yesterday. I can view the photos as a beautiful collage,</span><br><span class="line">28:19</span><br><span class="line">and I can share the whole Collection with just a tap right here. When I want to find a specific person in my library, I head to People &amp; Pets.</span><br><span class="line">28:29</span><br><span class="line">And it now includes my favorite groups of people for the first time! Here&#x27;s me with my husband Don</span><br><span class="line">28:36</span><br><span class="line">and with my best friends. The new Trips section gathers all your memorable adventures in one place.</span><br><span class="line">28:42</span><br><span class="line">I love that they autoplay so I can remember my trips while I browse. I can quickly jump back in time and revisit a trip</span><br><span class="line">28:50</span><br><span class="line">like this one to Patagonia in 2021. Since everyone&#x27;s photo library is unique, Photos is now customizable</span><br><span class="line">28:59</span><br><span class="line">so you can elevate the topics that are most important to you. You can reorder Collections to put them in the order you like.</span><br><span class="line">29:06</span><br><span class="line">I&#x27;ve put Pinned Collections right here. It&#x27;s where I can keep things I access frequently</span><br><span class="line">29:11</span><br><span class="line">like Favorites, photos I&#x27;ve recently saved, the places I&#x27;ve been, and even an album of my favorite climbs.</span><br><span class="line">29:18</span><br><span class="line">And we have one more new space to make the Photos app your very own and enjoy your best moments.</span><br><span class="line">29:24</span><br><span class="line">If you swipe right from the grid, you&#x27;ll find the new Carousel, which highlights your best content in a beautiful, poster-like view.</span><br><span class="line">29:32</span><br><span class="line">Photos you&#x27;ve marked as Favorites are here, and so are Featured Photos surfaced by the app.</span><br><span class="line">29:38</span><br><span class="line">And you can customize this too. Here, I&#x27;ve added a favorite trip to Crater Lake.</span><br><span class="line">29:45</span><br><span class="line">Each day, the Carousel surprises you with a new set of photos to enjoy for each of these.</span><br><span class="line">29:50</span><br><span class="line">And that&#x27;s a quick peek at the new Photos app. Now, back to you, Craig!</span><br><span class="line">29:55</span><br><span class="line">Craig: So that&#x27;s iOS 18, a big release that brings deeper customization to iPhone,</span><br><span class="line">30:02</span><br><span class="line">new ways to stay connected in Messages and Mail, enhancements to privacy, and the biggest Photos redesign ever,</span><br><span class="line">30:11</span><br><span class="line">making it even easier to relive those special moments! And so much more,</span><br><span class="line">30:16</span><br><span class="line">including an option for larger icons on the Home Screen, RCS messaging support, and Reminders integration in Calendar!</span><br><span class="line">30:24</span><br><span class="line">Next, I&#x27;ll hand it over to Ron to tell us the latest in Audio and Home.</span><br><span class="line">30:29</span><br><span class="line">♪ ♪</span><br><span class="line">Audio &amp; Home</span><br><span class="line">30:44</span><br><span class="line">Ron Huang: Whether you&#x27;re on the go, or at home, we have some great new features that bring more convenience</span><br><span class="line">30:50</span><br><span class="line">to the things you do every day and elevate the entertainment experience for everything you watch.</span><br><span class="line">30:56</span><br><span class="line">So let&#x27;s start off with AirPods, which are the most loved headphones in the world with an incredible audio experience.</span><br><span class="line">31:04</span><br><span class="line">This year, we&#x27;re making it even easier to interact with Siri for a seamless hands-free experience.</span><br><span class="line">31:10</span><br><span class="line">For those instances when you may not want to speak out loud in response to Siri, like on the bus to work or in those places that are a little too crowded,</span><br><span class="line">31:20</span><br><span class="line">we&#x27;ve created the ability to simply nod your head &quot;yes&quot; or gently shake your head &quot;no&quot; to interact.</span><br><span class="line">31:28</span><br><span class="line">[phone ringing] Siri: Call from Gam Gam. Answer it?</span><br><span class="line">31:34</span><br><span class="line">Okay. Ron: AirPods are also perfect for staying in touch with friends and colleagues, by taking calls anywhere, even in windy conditions</span><br><span class="line">31:43</span><br><span class="line">or places with loud background noise. So to ensure your voice will sound crystal clear, no matter your environment,</span><br><span class="line">31:50</span><br><span class="line">we&#x27;re bringing Voice Isolation to AirPods Pro. Powered by advanced computational audio</span><br><span class="line">31:56</span><br><span class="line">Voice Isolation removes the background noise around you, to deliver the best call quality.</span><br><span class="line">32:02</span><br><span class="line">Siri: Call from David. Answer it? - Oh, hey. Was just about to call you. The meeting went so well.</span><br><span class="line">32:10</span><br><span class="line">Also, sorry, it&#x27;s really noisy. Can you hear me okay? - That&#x27;s amazing news, and yeah. I can hear you totally fine.</span><br><span class="line">32:17</span><br><span class="line">Ron: AirPods are also great while playing games, thanks to their exceptional audio quality.</span><br><span class="line">32:22</span><br><span class="line">To level up this experience, we&#x27;re expanding Personalized Spatial Audio to include gaming, so that you&#x27;ll be</span><br><span class="line">32:28</span><br><span class="line">in the middle of the action like never before. We&#x27;ve built a new API so game developers</span><br><span class="line">32:34</span><br><span class="line">can easily deliver the most immersive listening experience. And we&#x27;re excited to announce that &quot;Need for Speed Mobile&quot;</span><br><span class="line">32:41</span><br><span class="line">by Tencent Games and EA will be one of the first titles with Personalized Spatial Audio coming this fall.</span><br><span class="line">32:48</span><br><span class="line">Now let&#x27;s turn to Home and tvOS.</span><br><span class="line">32:54</span><br><span class="line">This year, we&#x27;re introducing some updates that make watching TV even more enjoyable.</span><br><span class="line">32:59</span><br><span class="line">First, let&#x27;s talk about those moments when we&#x27;ve all wondered, &quot;Where have I seen this actor before?&quot;</span><br><span class="line">33:05</span><br><span class="line">or, &quot;Hey, what&#x27;s that song?&quot; For these times, we have a new feature we&#x27;re bringing to Apple TV+.</span><br><span class="line">33:11</span><br><span class="line">It&#x27;s called InSight. When you&#x27;re watching an Apple Original show or movie, just swipe down on the remote and InSight will show</span><br><span class="line">33:18</span><br><span class="line">the actors and their character names in real time. And if you&#x27;re curious about the song playing,</span><br><span class="line">33:24</span><br><span class="line">you can quickly see the track and add it to an Apple Music playlist to enjoy later.</span><br><span class="line">33:30</span><br><span class="line">InSight will also be available when using iPhone as your remote, perfect for when you&#x27;re watching with others.</span><br><span class="line">33:36</span><br><span class="line">Next, let&#x27;s turn to the audio experience on tvOS. We&#x27;re bringing Enhance Dialogue to more living rooms,</span><br><span class="line">33:43</span><br><span class="line">with support for TV speakers and receivers, along with AirPods and other Bluetooth devices.</span><br><span class="line">33:49</span><br><span class="line">And Enhance Dialogue now uses machine learning for even greater vocal clarity,</span><br><span class="line">33:55</span><br><span class="line">ensuring that the actors&#x27; dialogue will always cut through. - Go, go, go, go, go! - Rory, you are driving recklessly.</span><br><span class="line">34:02</span><br><span class="line">- I&#x27;m in the middle of a high-speed car chase. - Rory, you&#x27;re in crisis. - No, I&#x27;m not.</span><br><span class="line">34:08</span><br><span class="line">The situation is a crisis. I&#x27;m fine. Ron: We&#x27;re also making subtitles more convenient.</span><br><span class="line">34:13</span><br><span class="line">With many of us turning to subtitles more often, they&#x27;ll now appear at just the right times, like when you mute the volume or when you skip back.</span><br><span class="line">34:29</span><br><span class="line">Ron: Now let&#x27;s talk visuals. Apple TV has always delivered a theater-like experience to the home.</span><br><span class="line">34:36</span><br><span class="line">And this year, we&#x27;re adding to the experience with support for 21 by 9 projectors!</span><br><span class="line">34:41</span><br><span class="line">With 21 by 9, you&#x27;ll be able to view widescreen movies exactly as the directors intended.</span><br><span class="line">34:47</span><br><span class="line">And in between movies, you can enjoy amazing and visually interesting screen savers</span><br><span class="line">34:52</span><br><span class="line">on Apple TV. We&#x27;re making it even easier to choose what plays, including a brand-new Portraits category with stunning color effects</span><br><span class="line">35:00</span><br><span class="line">and image segmentation, framing your photos like art in a gallery. Or switch to TV and Movies</span><br><span class="line">35:07</span><br><span class="line">and enjoy moments from Apple TV+ shows you love like this one from &quot;Foundation.&quot; We&#x27;re also adding one more really cool screen saver</span><br><span class="line">35:15</span><br><span class="line">as Snoopy and Woodstock take over the screen. Whenever your Apple TV becomes idle,</span><br><span class="line">35:20</span><br><span class="line">Snoopy springs to life with delightful animations. We&#x27;re thrilled to bring everyone&#x27;s favorite beagle to your living room!</span><br><span class="line">35:28</span><br><span class="line">So that&#x27;s Audio and Home, bringing you more convenient ways to interact with AirPods, new entertainment experiences</span><br><span class="line">35:35</span><br><span class="line">with Apple TV, and there&#x27;s more.

To track intensity, we designed a new way to rate your workouts.</span><br><span class="line">36:35</span><br><span class="line">Using calorimetry data, like heart rate, pace, and elevation, plus your personal data, like age and weight,</span><br><span class="line">36:43</span><br><span class="line">a powerful new algorithm automatically translates our sensor data into an estimate of your Effort rating.</span><br><span class="line">36:49</span><br><span class="line">After your workout, you can review the rating on the Summary page, ranging from 1, easy, to 10, all out.</span><br><span class="line">36:56</span><br><span class="line">And you can even adjust your Effort rating up or down to get it just right. Your Effort rating and workout duration are then used</span><br><span class="line">37:03</span><br><span class="line">to calculate your Training Load. You&#x27;ll be able to see if you&#x27;re holding steady, above your average and can safely progress and improve,</span><br><span class="line">37:11</span><br><span class="line">or when you&#x27;re well above your average and should pay close attention to better avoid exhaustion or injury.</span><br><span class="line">37:17</span><br><span class="line">We think Training Load will help enthusiasts and elite athletes get to the next level with data, insights,</span><br><span class="line">37:24</span><br><span class="line">and motivation they need to make the best decisions about their training. And we&#x27;ve now made it even easier for everyone to gain more insights</span><br><span class="line">37:33</span><br><span class="line">from the Fitness app on iPhone by giving you the ability to customize the Summary Tab to show the information you want to see,</span><br><span class="line">37:39</span><br><span class="line">including new metrics like weekly running distance. The personalization even extends to your Activity rings</span><br><span class="line">37:45</span><br><span class="line">where you can now adjust your goals by the day of the week. Or if you have an injury that&#x27;s making it harder to close your rings,</span><br><span class="line">37:52</span><br><span class="line">or maybe you just need a day off, you can pause them, for a rest day, week, or more and keep your award streak going!</span><br><span class="line">37:59</span><br><span class="line">Those are some of the new ways watchOS11 will help keep you active. And now here&#x27;s Sumbul to tell you about a new app</span><br><span class="line">38:06</span><br><span class="line">that will give you a better picture of your health. Dr. Sumbul Ahmad Desai: Understanding how your body responds</span><br><span class="line">38:12</span><br><span class="line">and recovers from exercise and other aspects of your life is an important part of your overall health.</span><br><span class="line">38:18</span><br><span class="line">Because Apple Watch can track key vitals while you sleep, like heart rate, respiratory rate, and wrist temperature,</span><br><span class="line">38:23</span><br><span class="line">it can give you a deeper understanding of your body and help you identify when something might be off.</span><br><span class="line">38:29</span><br><span class="line">So with watchOS 11, these metrics are the foundation of the insightful new Vitals app</span><br><span class="line">38:35</span><br><span class="line">where you can check in on your daily health status, and explore your most important health metrics with just a glance.</span><br><span class="line">38:42</span><br><span class="line">You can also see how your metrics relate to your typical range, which is determined from your own historical information</span><br><span class="line">38:48</span><br><span class="line">and an algorithm developed using real-world data from the Apple Heart and Movement Study. For additional insights, your metrics will be highlighted</span><br><span class="line">38:55</span><br><span class="line">when they are outside of your typical range with details on what&#x27;s changed over the last week.</span><br><span class="line">39:01</span><br><span class="line">And when multiple metrics are out of range, you will be notified with a tailored message to help you understand</span><br><span class="line">39:07</span><br><span class="line">how these changes may be linked to other aspects of your life, such as alcohol, elevation changes, or even illness.</span><br><span class="line">39:13</span><br><span class="line">And that&#x27;s the Vitals app, a new way to quickly view your most important health metrics, receive alerts when it&#x27;s time</span><br><span class="line">39:20</span><br><span class="line">to pay more attention to your body, and gain better context when it comes to your health.</span><br><span class="line">39:26</span><br><span class="line">Now let&#x27;s talk about another time when context about your health matters, which is during pregnancy.</span><br><span class="line">39:32</span><br><span class="line">Cycle Tracking can now show you gestational age to support you during this important time.</span><br><span class="line">39:37</span><br><span class="line">The Health app will display your pregnancy across all charts and prompt you to review things like your high heart rate notification threshold,</span><br><span class="line">39:45</span><br><span class="line">since heart rate often increases during pregnancy. Those are some of the advances in Health.</span><br><span class="line">39:50</span><br><span class="line">And now back to David to tell you what&#x27;s coming to keep you connected. David: With Apple Watch, you can have quick and meaningful</span><br><span class="line">39:58</span><br><span class="line">interactions right on your wrist, making it so easy to stay connected to the world around you and the people you care about</span><br><span class="line">40:04</span><br><span class="line">without always needing to take your iPhone out of your pocket. Whether it&#x27;s using Apple Pay to buy your morning coffee or hop on the subway,</span><br><span class="line">40:11</span><br><span class="line">telling Siri to add an item to your grocery list, or replying to a message from a friend,</span><br><span class="line">40:16</span><br><span class="line">you can do it all with just the raise of a wrist. And last year, we introduced the Smart Stack.</span><br><span class="line">40:22</span><br><span class="line">It&#x27;s another way to keep you connected to important information with just a scroll of the digital crown.</span><br><span class="line">40:27</span><br><span class="line">This year, it becomes even more intelligent by automatically adding new widgets right when you need them,</span><br><span class="line">40:33</span><br><span class="line">like the precipitation widget to alert you before it rains, or the Translate widget for when you&#x27;re traveling somewhere new.</span><br><span class="line">40:39</span><br><span class="line">Just tap to open the new Translate app on Apple Watch, which uses machine learning models for speech recognition and translation.</span><br><span class="line">40:47</span><br><span class="line">You can now simply dictate to see and hear it right on your wrist! [speaking Korean]</span><br><span class="line">40:52</span><br><span class="line">The Smart Stack also becomes more capable with Live Activities coming to Apple Watch, so you&#x27;ll have all the details for your favorite events.</span><br><span class="line">41:00</span><br><span class="line">And you can use features like Check In, which lets a friend know you made it back home safely and is now on Apple Watch with additional support for workouts.</span><br><span class="line">41:09</span><br><span class="line">During a late-night run, your friend will know to keep an eye out, and will be updated when you end your workout</span><br><span class="line">41:14</span><br><span class="line">so you both have peace of mind. Developers can also show Live Activities in the Smart Stack,</span><br><span class="line">41:20</span><br><span class="line">so you can see updates in the moment like when your ride is coming for apps like Uber! And with the new Double Tap API, they can also define actions within apps,</span><br><span class="line">41:29</span><br><span class="line">like Sprout Baby Tracker, to log your baby&#x27;s time asleep without waking them!</span><br><span class="line">41:35</span><br><span class="line">Having access to all of these powerful capabilities right on your wrist makes Apple Watch so indispensable, and being able to customize</span><br><span class="line">41:44</span><br><span class="line">your watch face is one of the ways that makes it incredibly personal to you. With the popular Photos face, there is something special</span><br><span class="line">41:51</span><br><span class="line">about seeing an important person or moment every time you raise your wrist. Now, watchOS 11 will help you find the perfect photos for your watch face.</span><br><span class="line">42:00</span><br><span class="line">Machine learning intelligently identifies, scores, and curates the best photos</span><br><span class="line">42:06</span><br><span class="line">based on facial expressions, aesthetics, and composition. Then, a custom algorithm elegantly frames the image with the time.</span><br><span class="line">42:14</span><br><span class="line">You can select a bold color, choose monotone for a sleek look, or create something that is unique and personal to you.</span><br><span class="line">42:22</span><br><span class="line">That&#x27;s what&#x27;s coming in watchOS 11: a redesigned Photos face, a more intelligent Smart Stack, Training Load, the Vitals app,</span><br><span class="line">42:30</span><br><span class="line">new APIs for developers, and so much more, like turn-by-turn directions for walking and hiking routes you&#x27;ve created.</span><br><span class="line">42:38</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re so excited about all the new ways to help you stay connected, active, and healthy.</span><br><span class="line">42:44</span><br><span class="line">Back to you, Craig. ♪ ♪</span><br><span class="line">iPadOS</span><br><span class="line">43:04</span><br><span class="line">Craig: Next, let&#x27;s talk about iPadOS, which powers our strongest lineup ever,</span><br><span class="line">43:10</span><br><span class="line">including the incredibly thin and powerful iPad Pro and the redesigned iPad Air, now available in two sizes.</span><br><span class="line">43:18</span><br><span class="line">Together with the latest versions of Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro and game-changing accessories like Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard,</span><br><span class="line">43:27</span><br><span class="line">it creates an experience that&#x27;s in a category of its own. Our next release, iPadOS 18, starts with features you saw in iOS,</span><br><span class="line">43:36</span><br><span class="line">like new ways to personalize your Home Screen, customize Control Center, and relive special moments in the Photos app.</span><br><span class="line">43:43</span><br><span class="line">iPadOS 18 also brings exciting new ways to get things done,</span><br><span class="line">43:49</span><br><span class="line">reimagined with Apple Pencil, and a big update to apps designed for the distinct capabilities of iPad.</span><br><span class="line">43:56</span><br><span class="line">Apps are fundamental to the iPad experience. In iPadOS 18, we&#x27;re making them even better,</span><br><span class="line">44:03</span><br><span class="line">starting with a new floating tab bar, which makes it easier to navigate to different parts of an app</span><br><span class="line">44:08</span><br><span class="line">and keeps your content edge to edge in apps like Apple TV. When you want to explore more, the tab bar morphs into the sidebar.</span><br><span class="line">44:17</span><br><span class="line">If you use a specific tab often, you can customize the tab bar to keep your favorites within easy reach.</span><br><span class="line">44:24</span><br><span class="line">This redesigned experience works in apps across the system. We&#x27;ve also made it easier to browse your documents in apps like Pages,</span><br><span class="line">44:32</span><br><span class="line">Keynote, Numbers, and Swift Playgrounds, giving each app a distinct new look.</span><br><span class="line">44:38</span><br><span class="line">And throughout your experience, you&#x27;ll discover refined animations. You&#x27;ll notice them as you open files or preview them with Quick Look,</span><br><span class="line">44:46</span><br><span class="line">and they smoothly zoom into view, or when the tab bar elegantly morphs into the sidebar and back.</span><br><span class="line">44:53</span><br><span class="line">Across apps, animations will feel even more responsive. And for developers, all these new elements are</span><br><span class="line">45:00</span><br><span class="line">available as APIs to adopt in your apps too. Now let&#x27;s take a look at updates to SharePlay and Freeform.</span><br><span class="line">45:08</span><br><span class="line">One of SharePlay&#x27;s best features is screen sharing! It&#x27;s a great way to help friends and family from afar,</span><br><span class="line">45:15</span><br><span class="line">and we&#x27;re making it better in two ways. Now you can tap and draw on your screen</span><br><span class="line">45:20</span><br><span class="line">to point out what they should do on theirs. And if you need to assist more directly, you can ask for permission</span><br><span class="line">45:27</span><br><span class="line">to remotely control their iPad or iPhone.</span><br><span class="line">45:34</span><br><span class="line">- Hope that helps. Craig: And Freeform adds Scenes, an all-new way</span><br><span class="line">45:40</span><br><span class="line">to select sections of a board to present them one by one. Next, I want to talk about a feat that some may have concluded</span><br><span class="line">45:48</span><br><span class="line">must be a mathematical impossibility. That&#x27;s right, we&#x27;re bringing Calculator to iPad.</span><br><span class="line">45:55</span><br><span class="line">By leveraging what makes iPad so unique, it makes solving math easier than ever.</span><br><span class="line">46:01</span><br><span class="line">It starts with the Calculator that you know from iPhone, updated to take advantage of the larger iPad display,</span><br><span class="line">46:08</span><br><span class="line">along with some new tricks like history and unit conversions. But the real magic of Calculator on iPad is unlocked</span><br><span class="line">46:15</span><br><span class="line">when you use it with your Apple Pencil, an iPad superpower. Apple Pencil has changed the way you can take notes,</span><br><span class="line">46:22</span><br><span class="line">draw, and even design with iPad. And now, it&#x27;s changing the way you do math with a feature we call Math Notes.</span><br><span class="line">46:31</span><br><span class="line">Let&#x27;s see it in action with Jenny. Jenny Chen: I&#x27;m so excited to show you the new Math Notes experience.</span><br><span class="line">46:38</span><br><span class="line">I get to it by just tapping the new calculator button right here. And with my Apple Pencil, I&#x27;ll just start writing out expressions</span><br><span class="line">46:46</span><br><span class="line">like I would on a piece of paper. As soon as I write an equals sign, Calculator immediately solves it for me!</span><br><span class="line">46:54</span><br><span class="line">And even shows me the result in handwriting like my own! When I make a change, the results update live.</span><br><span class="line">47:02</span><br><span class="line">And I can go beyond basic math with all of the same functions from the scientific calculator.</span><br><span class="line">47:08</span><br><span class="line">I can save my Math Notes and come back to them later if I&#x27;m working on different things. Like here, where I&#x27;m working on a budget</span><br><span class="line">47:16</span><br><span class="line">for my team&#x27;s upcoming table tennis tournament. Since I&#x27;m in Math Notes, I can sum these costs quickly</span><br><span class="line">47:22</span><br><span class="line">by just drawing a line underneath them. It&#x27;s so natural. Math Notes are also really powerful when it comes to more complex math.</span><br><span class="line">47:32</span><br><span class="line">Here, I have a physics problem my teammate and I are working on. We&#x27;re calculating the maximum height of a table tennis ball</span><br><span class="line">47:39</span><br><span class="line">when I hit it with different speeds and angles. Math Notes supports variables, so I&#x27;ve declared a few here,</span><br><span class="line">47:45</span><br><span class="line">and there&#x27;s an expression below, which uses these variables to help me calculate the height.</span><br><span class="line">47:51</span><br><span class="line">What&#x27;s powerful about variables is that if I change one, like the velocity of my shot, it will change the related results too.</span><br><span class="line">48:01</span><br><span class="line">And if I want to see how this speed impacts the height visually, I can. I&#x27;ll just put &quot;y equals&quot; in front of this equation.</span><br><span class="line">48:10</span><br><span class="line">And now when I tap the equals sign, I have an option to create a graph.</span><br><span class="line">48:16</span><br><span class="line">And if I&#x27;m curious how the height will be impacted by the angle of my shot, I can hover my Pencil over the angle and adjust it</span><br><span class="line">48:24</span><br><span class="line">to see how it affects my graph in real time. It&#x27;s an easy way to explore equations in math.</span><br><span class="line">48:30</span><br><span class="line">And that&#x27;s just a quick look at Math Notes in Calculator. Back to you, Craig.</span><br><span class="line">48:36</span><br><span class="line">Craig: Math Notes are perfect for working through a problem set, or just tackling the math we run into day to day.</span><br><span class="line">48:43</span><br><span class="line">And this all works in Notes too. When you need to crunch numbers, Notes has all of the new math capabilities from Calculator.</span><br><span class="line">48:50</span><br><span class="line">Just as we&#x27;ve reimagined math on iPad, we&#x27;ve also reimagined handwriting in Notes</span><br><span class="line">48:57</span><br><span class="line">with a new feature called Smart Script. Notes already has great handwriting features,</span><br><span class="line">49:02</span><br><span class="line">like the ability to select and copy your writing, or even make it straighter. With Smart Script, we&#x27;re making handwriting your notes smoother than ever.</span><br><span class="line">49:10</span><br><span class="line">It starts with improving the appearance of your writing, as you write. We use a powerful on-device machine learning model</span><br><span class="line">49:18</span><br><span class="line">to re-create your handwriting style from your notes, which unlocks new capabilities.</span><br><span class="line">49:24</span><br><span class="line">Just scribble your thoughts as fast as you have them and Smart Script refines your handwriting as you go.</span><br><span class="line">49:31</span><br><span class="line">It&#x27;s still your own writing, but it looks smoother, straighter, and more legible. Smart Script further accelerates your writing flow</span><br><span class="line">49:39</span><br><span class="line">by making handwriting just as flexible as typed text. Now you can just paste typed text into a handwritten note,</span><br><span class="line">49:46</span><br><span class="line">and it will appear in your own style. Spell check works just as you would expect and fixes mistakes inline.</span><br><span class="line">49:53</span><br><span class="line">When you decide you need to add to something you&#x27;ve already written, just tap and hold with your Apple Pencil</span><br><span class="line">49:58</span><br><span class="line">and your text will flow out of the way to create more space. If you want to erase something you can just scratch it out.</span><br><span class="line">50:07</span><br><span class="line">Smart Script makes your handwritten notes more effective, fluid, and easier to read.</span><br><span class="line">50:12</span><br><span class="line">And with other enhancements to typed notes, including collapsible sections, it&#x27;s never been a better time to be a notetaker!</span><br><span class="line">50:20</span><br><span class="line">And that&#x27;s iPadOS 18, taking the distinct experience of iPad further</span><br><span class="line">50:26</span><br><span class="line">with a big update to apps that makes navigating easier and more responsive, and new ways to work that have been reimagined with Apple Pencil.</span><br><span class="line">50:34</span><br><span class="line">Next, let&#x27;s talk about macOS. ♪ ♪</span><br><span class="line">macOS</span><br><span class="line">50:53</span><br><span class="line">The all-star combination of the power of Apple silicon and the legendary ease of use of macOS have made the Mac more capable than ever.</span><br><span class="line">51:01</span><br><span class="line">And we&#x27;re so excited to take macOS to new heights and embark on the next chapter of our journey of productivity and creativity!</span><br><span class="line">51:10</span><br><span class="line">But what should we call it?

Distracted briefly from their marathon hacky sack session,</span><br><span class="line">51:22</span><br><span class="line">they stumbled into their minibus and wove a trail toward the Sierras, eventually rolling to a stop in a beautiful national park.</span><br><span class="line">51:31</span><br><span class="line">Staring skyward up the towering trunks surrounding them, they felt a deep kinship with anything that could get that high.</span><br><span class="line">51:39</span><br><span class="line">They knew they&#x27;d found their spot. Welcome to macOS Sequoia.</span><br><span class="line">51:45</span><br><span class="line">The incredible features we talked about in iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 are going to be amazing for the ways you use Mac.</span><br><span class="line">51:54</span><br><span class="line">You can be even more expressive in Messages, Math Notes provide a helpful typed experience,</span><br><span class="line">52:01</span><br><span class="line">and you can easily plan a hike in Maps.

You can release your window right into place.</span><br><span class="line">55:38</span><br><span class="line">Quickly place tiles side by side, or place them into corners to keep even more apps in your view.</span><br><span class="line">55:44</span><br><span class="line">And new keyboard and menu shortcuts help you arrange your tiles even faster.</span><br><span class="line">55:49</span><br><span class="line">Now, let&#x27;s talk about video conferencing. When you&#x27;re on a video call, say goodbye to oversharing with the new presenter preview.</span><br><span class="line">55:58</span><br><span class="line">It lets you see what you&#x27;re about to share before you share it, and works with apps like FaceTime and Zoom.</span><br><span class="line">56:05</span><br><span class="line">And when you want to express yourself or just hide the laundry behind you, you can now replace your background with some beautiful built-in backgrounds,</span><br><span class="line">56:13</span><br><span class="line">or your own photos! Background replacements use Apple&#x27;s industry-leading segmentation</span><br><span class="line">56:19</span><br><span class="line">so you look your best while on a call. Now let&#x27;s talk about how we&#x27;re building on the foundation of Keychain</span><br><span class="line">56:26</span><br><span class="line">to help you manage your passwords. For over 25 years, we&#x27;ve been adding features</span><br><span class="line">56:31</span><br><span class="line">to make logging in to your accounts easier. And now, we&#x27;re introducing the Passwords app.</span><br><span class="line">56:37</span><br><span class="line">Passwords makes it easy to access your credentials and have them securely stored, all in one place.</span><br><span class="line">56:43</span><br><span class="line">Everything is organized for you, from your passwords to verification codes to security alerts.</span><br><span class="line">56:50</span><br><span class="line">You can find the app on Mac, iPad, iPhone, Vision Pro, and on Windows, with the iCloud for Windows app.</span><br><span class="line">56:57</span><br><span class="line">All the passwords securely sync across your devices, and if you use AutoFill,</span><br><span class="line">57:03</span><br><span class="line">your passwords will automatically populate in the Passwords app. Now, here&#x27;s Beth to tell you about Safari.</span><br><span class="line">57:12</span><br><span class="line">Beth Dakin: Safari offers an experience like no other browser on Mac. In macOS Sequoia, Safari is the world&#x27;s fastest browser,</span><br><span class="line">57:20</span><br><span class="line">enabling you to fly through the web with lightning speed. And it offers up to four hours more battery life</span><br><span class="line">57:26</span><br><span class="line">than Chrome when streaming video. Safari is also a trailblazer in privacy, with industry-leading Intelligent Tracking Prevention</span><br><span class="line">57:35</span><br><span class="line">and private browsing that&#x27;s actually private. It not only protects your history, it prevents websites</span><br><span class="line">57:40</span><br><span class="line">from seeing what you do while you browse. And it&#x27;s built on WebKit, which supports the latest</span><br><span class="line">57:46</span><br><span class="line">exciting web technologies and standards. If you missed anything we&#x27;ve added to Safari in the last few years,</span><br><span class="line">57:52</span><br><span class="line">it&#x27;s time to check it out! Safari has everything you need to feel at home,</span><br><span class="line">57:57</span><br><span class="line">like profiles, translation, and more. And in this release, we&#x27;re making it even better,</span><br><span class="line">58:03</span><br><span class="line">with easier ways to discover content and streamline your browsing. When you&#x27;re on a site, Safari can now help you discover</span><br><span class="line">58:10</span><br><span class="line">more about the page with Highlights. Safari uses machine learning to automatically detect</span><br><span class="line">58:16</span><br><span class="line">relevant information and highlight it for you as you browse. Highlights share helpful information, like directions, summaries,</span><br><span class="line">58:24</span><br><span class="line">and quick links to learn more about people, music, movies, and TV shows.</span><br><span class="line">58:29</span><br><span class="line">So if you&#x27;re planning a trip, you can effortlessly discover a hotel&#x27;s location and phone number right there.</span><br><span class="line">58:36</span><br><span class="line">You can listen to an artist&#x27;s music or check out a new show with just a click. And even get a summary, so you can get the gist before reading on.</span><br><span class="line">58:44</span><br><span class="line">Summaries are also integrated into a redesigned Reader. Reader instantly removes distractions from articles,</span><br><span class="line">58:52</span><br><span class="line">and now it can provide a table of contents and includes a helpful summary, right next to the article.</span><br><span class="line">58:58</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re bringing a distraction-free experience to video on the web as well with Viewer.</span><br><span class="line">59:03</span><br><span class="line">When Safari detects a video on the page, Viewer helps you put it front and center, while still giving you full access</span><br><span class="line">59:10</span><br><span class="line">to system playback controls, like AirPlay and Picture-in-Picture, and video automatically moves into Picture-in-Picture if you click away.</span><br><span class="line">59:18</span><br><span class="line">That&#x27;s a quick look at what&#x27;s new in Safari. Back to you, Craig. Craig: Let&#x27;s talk about gaming.</span><br><span class="line">59:25</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re so excited to see more and more game developers embracing the Mac with great games like these,</span><br><span class="line">59:31</span><br><span class="line">including the most recent game of the year, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3,&quot; all leveraging Metal 3</span><br><span class="line">59:37</span><br><span class="line">to deliver smooth frame rates, provide high-quality visuals, and take full advantage of Apple silicon.</span><br><span class="line">59:43</span><br><span class="line">Every Mac in the lineup can play today&#x27;s most cutting-edge games, like &quot;Death Stranding: Director&#x27;s Cut.&quot;</span><br><span class="line">59:49</span><br><span class="line">And so can iPhone 15 Pro and any iPad with an M-series chip.</span><br><span class="line">59:54</span><br><span class="line">And for developers, this creates a unified gaming platform across iPhone, iPad, and Mac,</span><br><span class="line">1:00:01</span><br><span class="line">spanning well over a hundred million devices and growing rapidly.</span><br><span class="line">1:00:06</span><br><span class="line">These devices are capable of playing an entirely new class of games!

So as we look to build in these incredible new capabilities,</span><br><span class="line">1:05:07</span><br><span class="line">we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products.</span><br><span class="line">1:05:13</span><br><span class="line">It has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you.</span><br><span class="line">1:05:18</span><br><span class="line">It has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.</span><br><span class="line">1:05:26</span><br><span class="line">Most importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine,</span><br><span class="line">1:05:34</span><br><span class="line">your relationships, your communications, and more. And, of course, it has to be built</span><br><span class="line">1:05:41</span><br><span class="line">with privacy from the ground up. Together, all of this goes beyond artificial intelligence.</span><br><span class="line">1:05:48</span><br><span class="line">It&#x27;s personal intelligence, and it&#x27;s the next big step for Apple.</span><br><span class="line">1:05:54</span><br><span class="line">♪ ♪</span><br><span class="line">1:06:12</span><br><span class="line">♪ ♪</span><br><span class="line">1:06:17</span><br><span class="line">Introducing Apple Intelligence, the new personal intelligence system</span><br><span class="line">1:06:22</span><br><span class="line">that makes your most personal products even more useful and delightful.</span><br><span class="line">1:06:28</span><br><span class="line">To tell you all about it, here&#x27;s Craig. ♪ ♪</span><br><span class="line">1:06:39</span><br><span class="line">Craig: This is a moment we&#x27;ve been working towards for a long time. We are tremendously excited about the power of generative models.</span><br><span class="line">1:06:47</span><br><span class="line">And there are already some really impressive chat tools out there that perform a vast array of tasks using world knowledge.</span><br><span class="line">1:06:53</span><br><span class="line">But these tools know very little about you or your needs. With iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia,</span><br><span class="line">1:07:01</span><br><span class="line">we are embarking on a new journey to bring you intelligence that understands you.</span><br><span class="line">1:07:07</span><br><span class="line">Apple Intelligence is the personal intelligence system that puts powerful generative models right at the core of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</span><br><span class="line">1:07:16</span><br><span class="line">It draws on your personal context to give you intelligence that&#x27;s most helpful and relevant for you.</span><br><span class="line">1:07:22</span><br><span class="line">It protects your privacy at every step. And it is deeply integrated into our platforms and throughout the apps</span><br><span class="line">1:07:30</span><br><span class="line">you rely on to communicate, work, and express yourself. Let&#x27;s take a closer look at Apple Intelligence</span><br><span class="line">1:07:36</span><br><span class="line">starting with its incredible capabilities. Then, we&#x27;ll tell you about its unique architecture.</span><br><span class="line">1:07:43</span><br><span class="line">And after that, we&#x27;ll show you how it elevates so many of your everyday experiences.</span><br><span class="line">1:07:48</span><br><span class="line">Let&#x27;s begin with capabilities. Apple Intelligence will enable your iPhone, iPad, and Mac</span><br><span class="line">1:07:55</span><br><span class="line">to understand and create language, as well as images, and take action for you to simplify interactions across your apps.</span><br><span class="line">1:08:03</span><br><span class="line">And what&#x27;s truly unique is its understanding of your personal context. Language and text are fundamental to how we communicate and work.</span><br><span class="line">1:08:11</span><br><span class="line">And the large language models built into Apple Intelligence deliver deep natural language understanding,</span><br><span class="line">1:08:17</span><br><span class="line">making so many of your day-to-day tasks faster and easier. For example, your iPhone can prioritize your notifications</span><br><span class="line">1:08:25</span><br><span class="line">to minimize unnecessary distractions, while ensuring you don&#x27;t miss something important. Apple Intelligence also powers brand-new Writing Tools</span><br><span class="line">1:08:33</span><br><span class="line">that you can access systemwide to feel more confident in your writing. Writing Tools can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text for you,</span><br><span class="line">1:08:42</span><br><span class="line">whether you are working on an article or blog post, condensing ideas to share with your classmates,</span><br><span class="line">1:08:48</span><br><span class="line">or looking over a review before you post it online. And they are available automatically across Mail,</span><br><span class="line">1:08:54</span><br><span class="line">Notes, Safari, Pages, Keynote, and even your third-party apps. In addition to language, Apple Intelligence offers</span><br><span class="line">1:09:01</span><br><span class="line">a host of capabilities for images. From photos, to emojis, and GIFs,</span><br><span class="line">1:09:07</span><br><span class="line">it&#x27;s so much fun to express ourselves visually. And now you can create totally original images</span><br><span class="line">1:09:13</span><br><span class="line">to make everyday conversations even more enjoyable. And because Apple Intelligence understands the people in your photo library,</span><br><span class="line">1:09:21</span><br><span class="line">you can personalize these images for your conversations. So when you wish a friend a happy birthday,</span><br><span class="line">1:09:27</span><br><span class="line">you can create an image of them surrounded by cake, balloons, and flowers to make it extra festive.</span><br><span class="line">1:09:33</span><br><span class="line">And the next time you tell Mom that she&#x27;s your hero, you can send an image of her in a superhero cape</span><br><span class="line">1:09:39</span><br><span class="line">to really land your point. You can create images in three unique styles: Sketch, Illustration, and Animation.</span><br><span class="line">1:09:49</span><br><span class="line">In addition to Messages, this experience is built into apps throughout the system, like Notes, Freeform, Keynote, and Pages.</span><br><span class="line">1:09:59</span><br><span class="line">Another way Apple Intelligence is deeply impactful is its ability to take action across your apps.</span><br><span class="line">1:10:05</span><br><span class="line">The greatest source of tools for taking actions is already in your pocket with the apps you use every day.</span><br><span class="line">1:10:13</span><br><span class="line">And we have designed Apple Intelligence so it can tap into these tools and carry out tasks on your behalf.</span><br><span class="line">1:10:19</span><br><span class="line">So you can say things like, &quot;Pull up the files that Joz shared with me last week,&quot; or, &quot;Show me all the photos of Mom, Olivia, and me,&quot;</span><br><span class="line">1:10:28</span><br><span class="line">or, &quot;Play the podcast that my wife sent the other day.&quot; We are designing Apple Intelligence to be able to orchestrate these</span><br><span class="line">1:10:35</span><br><span class="line">and hundreds of other actions for you, so you can accomplish more while saving time.</span><br><span class="line">1:10:40</span><br><span class="line">There&#x27;s one more critical building block for personal intelligence, and that&#x27;s an understanding of your personal context.</span><br><span class="line">1:10:48</span><br><span class="line">Apple Intelligence is grounded in your personal information and context with the ability to retrieve and analyze the most relevant data</span><br><span class="line">1:10:56</span><br><span class="line">from across your apps, as well as to reference the content on your screen, like an email or calendar event you are looking at.</span><br><span class="line">1:11:04</span><br><span class="line">This can be incredibly useful in so many moments throughout the day. Suppose one of my meetings is being re-scheduled</span><br><span class="line">1:11:11</span><br><span class="line">for late in the afternoon, and I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s going to prevent me from getting to my daughter&#x27;s play performance on time.</span><br><span class="line">1:11:16</span><br><span class="line">Apple Intelligence can process the relevant personal data to assist me. It can understand who my daughter is, the play details she sent</span><br><span class="line">1:11:24</span><br><span class="line">several days ago, the time and location for my meeting, and predicted traffic between my office and the theater.</span><br><span class="line">1:11:32</span><br><span class="line">Understanding this kind of personal context is essential for delivering truly helpful intelligence.</span><br><span class="line">1:11:39</span><br><span class="line">But it has to be done right. You should not have to hand over all the details of your life</span><br><span class="line">1:11:44</span><br><span class="line">to be warehoused and analyzed in someone&#x27;s AI cloud. With Apple Intelligence, powerful intelligence goes</span><br><span class="line">1:11:51</span><br><span class="line">hand in hand with powerful privacy. Let me tell you more about its architecture,</span><br><span class="line">1:11:58</span><br><span class="line">and how it is built with privacy at the core. The cornerstone of the personal intelligence system</span><br><span class="line">1:12:04</span><br><span class="line">is on-device processing. We have integrated it deep into your iPhone, iPad, and Mac</span><br><span class="line">1:12:10</span><br><span class="line">and throughout your apps, so it&#x27;s aware of your personal data, without collecting your personal data.</span><br><span class="line">1:12:16</span><br><span class="line">This is only possible through our unique integration of hardware and software, and our years-long investment</span><br><span class="line">1:12:23</span><br><span class="line">in building advanced silicon for on-device intelligence. Deeply-integrated generative models require immense processing power.</span><br><span class="line">1:12:31</span><br><span class="line">And with our most advanced Apple silicon, the A17 Pro and M-family of chips,</span><br><span class="line">1:12:37</span><br><span class="line">we have the computational foundation to power Apple Intelligence.</span><br><span class="line">1:12:42</span><br><span class="line">This personal intelligence system is comprised of highly-capable large language and diffusion models that are specialized for your everyday tasks,</span><br><span class="line">1:12:50</span><br><span class="line">and can adapt on the fly to your current activity. It also includes an on-device semantic index</span><br><span class="line">1:12:57</span><br><span class="line">that can organize and surface information from across your apps. When you make a request, Apple Intelligence uses its semantic index</span><br><span class="line">1:13:05</span><br><span class="line">to identify the relevant personal data, and feeds it to the generative models so they have the personal context to best assist you.</span><br><span class="line">1:13:12</span><br><span class="line">Many of these models run entirely on-device. There are times, though, when you need models</span><br><span class="line">1:13:18</span><br><span class="line">that are larger than what fits in your pocket today. Servers can help with this. But traditionally, servers can also store your data</span><br><span class="line">1:13:27</span><br><span class="line">without you realizing it, and use it in ways you did not intend. And since server software is only accessible to its owners,</span><br><span class="line">1:13:35</span><br><span class="line">even if a company says it&#x27;s not misusing your data, you are unable to verify their claim, or if it changes over time.</span><br><span class="line">1:13:41</span><br><span class="line">In contrast, when you use an Apple device like your iPhone, you are in control of your data, where it is stored, and who can access it.</span><br><span class="line">1:13:50</span><br><span class="line">And because the software image for your iPhone is accessible to independent experts, they can continuously verify its privacy.</span><br><span class="line">1:13:58</span><br><span class="line">We want to extend the privacy and security of your iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence for you.</span><br><span class="line">1:14:06</span><br><span class="line">So we have created Private Cloud Compute. Private Cloud Compute allows Apple Intelligence to flex</span><br><span class="line">1:14:14</span><br><span class="line">and scale its computational capacity, and draw on even larger, server-based models for more complex requests,</span><br><span class="line">1:14:22</span><br><span class="line">while protecting your privacy. These models run on servers we have especially created using Apple silicon.</span><br><span class="line">1:14:29</span><br><span class="line">These Apple silicon servers offer the privacy and security of your iPhone from the silicon on up,</span><br><span class="line">1:14:35</span><br><span class="line">draw on the security properties of the Swift programming language, and run software with transparency built in.</span><br><span class="line">1:14:43</span><br><span class="line">When you make a request, Apple Intelligence analyzes whether it can be processed on-device.</span><br><span class="line">1:14:48</span><br><span class="line">If it needs greater computational capacity, it can draw on Private Cloud Compute, and send only the data that&#x27;s relevant</span><br><span class="line">1:14:55</span><br><span class="line">to your task to be processed on Apple silicon servers. Your data is never stored or made accessible to Apple.</span><br><span class="line">1:15:03</span><br><span class="line">It&#x27;s used exclusively to fulfill your request. And just like your iPhone, independent experts can inspect</span><br><span class="line">1:15:11</span><br><span class="line">the code that runs on these servers to verify this privacy promise. In fact, Private Cloud Compute cryptographically ensures</span><br><span class="line">1:15:19</span><br><span class="line">your iPhone, iPad, and Mac will refuse to talk to a server unless its software has been publicly logged for inspection.</span><br><span class="line">1:15:27</span><br><span class="line">This sets a brand-new standard for privacy in AI, and unlocks intelligence you can trust.</span><br><span class="line">1:15:34</span><br><span class="line">So that&#x27;s a look at the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence and its groundbreaking privacy protections.</span><br><span class="line">1:15:42</span><br><span class="line">Now we&#x27;d love to show you how it will transform your apps and experiences across iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia,</span><br><span class="line">1:15:52</span><br><span class="line">from a big leap forward for Siri, to powerful tools for writing and communication,</span><br><span class="line">1:15:57</span><br><span class="line">and fun visual ways to express yourself. Let&#x27;s start with Siri. Here&#x27;s Kelsey to tell you more.</span><br><span class="line">1:16:05</span><br><span class="line">Kelsey Peterson: Today, Siri helps you get everyday tasks done quickly and easily. In fact, Siri users make 1.5 billion voice requests every single day.</span><br><span class="line">1:16:15</span><br><span class="line">Thirteen years ago, we introduced Siri. The original intelligent assistant.</span><br><span class="line">1:16:21</span><br><span class="line">And we had an ambitious vision for it. We&#x27;ve been steadily building towards that vision.</span><br><span class="line">1:16:26</span><br><span class="line">And now, thanks to the incredible power of Apple Intelligence, we have the foundational capabilities to take a major step forward.</span><br><span class="line">1:16:34</span><br><span class="line">So we can make Siri more natural, more contextually relevant, and of course, more personal to you.</span><br><span class="line">1:16:41</span><br><span class="line">Right off the bat, you&#x27;ll see Siri&#x27;s got a new look. Let me show you.</span><br><span class="line">1:16:47</span><br><span class="line">When you talk to Siri, you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s more deeply integrated into the system experience, with this elegant glowing light</span><br><span class="line">1:16:53</span><br><span class="line">that wraps around the edge of your screen. And you can speak to Siri more naturally thanks to richer language understanding capabilities.</span><br><span class="line">1:17:01</span><br><span class="line">Even if I stumble over my words, Siri understands what I&#x27;m getting at. What does the weather look like for tomorrow at Muir Beach?</span><br><span class="line">1:17:08</span><br><span class="line">Oh, wait, I meant Muir Woods! Siri: The forecast is calling for clear skies in the morning</span><br><span class="line">1:17:15</span><br><span class="line">near Muir Woods National Monument. Kelsey: Sometimes it takes me a beat to figure out what I actually want to ask Siri,</span><br><span class="line">1:17:21</span><br><span class="line">and now it follows right along. Siri also maintains conversational context,</span><br><span class="line">1:17:27</span><br><span class="line">so I can follow up and say, &quot;Create an event for a hike there tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.&quot;</span><br><span class="line">1:17:34</span><br><span class="line">Siri: Hike is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on June 11. Kelsey: I didn&#x27;t have to mention Muir Woods again.</span><br><span class="line">1:17:41</span><br><span class="line">Siri understood what I meant when I said &quot;there.&quot; There are also certain times when you might not want</span><br><span class="line">1:17:46</span><br><span class="line">to speak to Siri out loud. What&#x27;s great is that now, at any time, you have the option to type to Siri.</span><br><span class="line">1:17:54</span><br><span class="line">With just a double tap at the bottom of the screen, I can quickly and quietly ask Siri to set an alarm.</span><br><span class="line">1:18:03</span><br><span class="line">And you can switch between text and voice, communicating in whatever way feels right for the moment.</span><br><span class="line">1:18:08</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re also laying the groundwork for some brand-new ways that Siri will be able to support you,</span><br><span class="line">1:18:14</span><br><span class="line">one of which is its extensive product knowledge. Siri now holds a great deal of information about features and settings</span><br><span class="line">1:18:23</span><br><span class="line">and can answer thousands of questions when you want to know how to do something on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.</span><br><span class="line">1:18:30</span><br><span class="line">Even if you don&#x27;t know exactly what a feature is called, you can just describe it and Siri will find the info you&#x27;re looking for.</span><br><span class="line">1:18:37</span><br><span class="line">Like this: &quot;How can I write a message now and have it be delivered tomorrow?&quot;</span><br><span class="line">1:18:43</span><br><span class="line">Siri understood what feature I was referring to, and now I have step-by-step guidance on how to use the new Send Later feature in Messages.</span><br><span class="line">1:18:50</span><br><span class="line">Everything I&#x27;ve showed you so far will be available from the moment you start using Apple Intelligence.</span><br><span class="line">1:18:55</span><br><span class="line">And over the course of the next year, we will be rolling out more features that make Siri even more personal and capable.</span><br><span class="line">1:19:01</span><br><span class="line">For one, Apple Intelligence will provide Siri with on-screen awareness, so it&#x27;ll be able to understand and take action</span><br><span class="line">1:19:08</span><br><span class="line">with things on your screen. For example, say a friend texts you his new address. Right from the Messages thread, you can say,</span><br><span class="line">1:19:16</span><br><span class="line">&quot;Add this address to his contact card,&quot; and Siri will take care of it.</span><br><span class="line">1:19:21</span><br><span class="line">Siri will also understand more of the things you get done in your apps. And with new orchestration capabilities provided by Apple Intelligence,</span><br><span class="line">1:19:30</span><br><span class="line">Siri will take actions inside apps on your behalf. Siri will have the ability to take hundreds of new actions</span><br><span class="line">1:19:37</span><br><span class="line">in and across apps, including some that leverage our new writing and image generation capabilities.</span><br><span class="line">1:19:44</span><br><span class="line">For example, you&#x27;ll be able to say, &quot;Show me my photos of Stacey in New York wearing her pink coat,&quot; and Siri will bring those right up.</span><br><span class="line">1:19:52</span><br><span class="line">Then you might say, &quot;Make this photo pop,&quot; and Siri will enhance it, just like that.</span><br><span class="line">1:19:58</span><br><span class="line">And Siri will be able to take actions across apps, so you could say, &quot;Add this to my note with Stacey&#x27;s bio,&quot;</span><br><span class="line">1:20:06</span><br><span class="line">and it will jump from the Photos app to the Notes app to make it happen. This is going to bring us closer to realizing our vision</span><br><span class="line">1:20:13</span><br><span class="line">in which Siri moves through the system in concert with you. This is made possible through significant enhancements</span><br><span class="line">1:20:20</span><br><span class="line">that we are making to App Intents, a framework that lets apps define a set of actions for Siri, Shortcuts, and other system experiences.</span><br><span class="line">1:20:29</span><br><span class="line">And this won&#x27;t be limited to apps made by Apple. For developers, they&#x27;ll be able to use the App Intents framework</span><br><span class="line">1:20:37</span><br><span class="line">to define actions in their apps and tap into Apple Intelligence too. So you might ask Siri to take a light trails video</span><br><span class="line">1:20:44</span><br><span class="line">in Pro Camera by Moment. Or ask Siri to share a summary of your meeting notes in an email you&#x27;re drafting to a teammate in Superhuman.</span><br><span class="line">1:20:51</span><br><span class="line">And this is only the beginning. Siri will be able to understand and take more actions in more apps over time.</span><br><span class="line">1:21:00</span><br><span class="line">There&#x27;s one more set of really cool and useful capabilities coming to Siri.</span><br><span class="line">1:21:05</span><br><span class="line">Thanks to Apple Intelligence, it has awareness of your personal context. With its semantic index of things like photos, calendar events,</span><br><span class="line">1:21:14</span><br><span class="line">and files, plus information that&#x27;s stashed in passing messages and emails, like hotel bookings,</span><br><span class="line">1:21:20</span><br><span class="line">PDFs of concert tickets, and links that your friends have shared, Siri will find and understand things it never could before.</span><br><span class="line">1:21:29</span><br><span class="line">And with the powerful privacy protections of Apple Intelligence, Siri will use this information to help you get things done</span><br><span class="line">1:21:36</span><br><span class="line">without compromising your privacy. You&#x27;ll be able to ask Siri to find something</span><br><span class="line">1:21:42</span><br><span class="line">when you can&#x27;t remember if it was in an email, a text, or a shared note, like some book recommendations that a friend sent you a while back.</span><br><span class="line">1:21:49</span><br><span class="line">Or for times when you&#x27;re filling out a form and need to input your driver&#x27;s license, Siri will be able to find</span><br><span class="line">1:21:55</span><br><span class="line">a photo of your license, extract your ID number, and type it into the form for you.</span><br><span class="line">1:22:01</span><br><span class="line">I want to show you one more demo that will give you a sense for how powerful Siri will be</span><br><span class="line">1:22:07</span><br><span class="line">when it draws on the personal context awareness and action capabilities built into Apple Intelligence.</span><br><span class="line">1:22:13</span><br><span class="line">Imagine that I am planning to pick my mom up from the airport, and I&#x27;m trying to figure out my timing.</span><br><span class="line">1:22:19</span><br><span class="line">Siri is going to be able to help me do this so easily. Siri, when is my mom&#x27;s flight landing?</span><br><span class="line">1:22:26</span><br><span class="line">What&#x27;s awesome is that Siri actually cross-references flight details that my mom shared with me by email with real-time flight tracking to give me her up-to-date arrival time.</span><br><span class="line">1:22:35</span><br><span class="line">What&#x27;s our lunch plan? I don&#x27;t always remember to add things to my calendar, and so I love that Siri can help me keep track of plans that I&#x27;ve made</span><br><span class="line">1:22:42</span><br><span class="line">in casual conversation, like this lunch reservation my mom mentioned in a text.</span><br><span class="line">1:22:47</span><br><span class="line">How long will it take us to get there from the airport? I haven&#x27;t had to jump from Mail to Messages to Maps</span><br><span class="line">1:22:54</span><br><span class="line">to figure out this plan. And a set of tasks that would have taken minutes on my own and honestly probably would have resulted in a call to my Mom</span><br><span class="line">1:23:01</span><br><span class="line">could be addressed in a matter of seconds. That&#x27;s just a glimpse of the ways in which Siri is going to become</span><br><span class="line">1:23:08</span><br><span class="line">more powerful and more personal thanks to Apple Intelligence. And all of these updates to Siri are also coming to iPad and Mac,</span><br><span class="line">1:23:17</span><br><span class="line">where Siri&#x27;s new design is a total game-changer. It makes Siri feel seamlessly integrated with your workflow.</span><br><span class="line">1:23:24</span><br><span class="line">Thanks to the capabilities of Apple Intelligence, this year marks the start of a new era for Siri.</span><br><span class="line">1:23:30</span><br><span class="line">Here&#x27;s Justin to show you more places throughout the system where Apple Intelligence simplifies and accelerates your tasks.</span><br><span class="line">1:23:39</span><br><span class="line">Justin Titi: Apple Intelligence unlocks incredible new ways to enhance your writing, whether you are tidying up your hastily-written class notes, ensuring your blog post reads</span><br><span class="line">1:23:47</span><br><span class="line">just right on Wordpress, or making sure your email is perfectly crafted. Let&#x27;s use Mail to take a closer look at how the systemwide Writing Tools</span><br><span class="line">1:23:55</span><br><span class="line">can help you communicate even more effectively. Rewrite gives you different versions of what you have written,</span><br><span class="line">1:24:02</span><br><span class="line">so you can choose the one you like best.</span><br><span class="line">1:24:11</span><br><span class="line">This is great for making sure your cover letter for that job you&#x27;re excited for lands perfectly.</span><br><span class="line">1:24:17</span><br><span class="line">And suggestions are shown inline, so you can go with the combination of flow and wording that works for you.</span><br><span class="line">1:24:23</span><br><span class="line">Rewrite also helps you get the tone right. Have you ever re-read a work email that you just wrote and thought, &quot;Oh, this might not go over well&quot;?</span><br><span class="line">1:24:31</span><br><span class="line">Well, now you can change the tone of that response to your colleague to make it sound more friendly, professional, or concise.</span><br><span class="line">1:24:39</span><br><span class="line">You can also describe how you&#x27;d like it rewritten. For example, you can invite your friends to a get-together</span><br><span class="line">1:24:45</span><br><span class="line">with a one-of-a-kind invitation written as a poem. Who could say no to that?</span><br><span class="line">1:24:50</span><br><span class="line">Another way Writing Tools can help you is with Proofread. Say you&#x27;re emailing your English professor.</span><br><span class="line">1:24:55</span><br><span class="line">With Proofread, you can nail grammar, word choice, and sentence structure to put your best foot forward.</span><br><span class="line">1:25:02</span><br><span class="line">You can review suggested edits and their explanations individually, or accept them all with a click.</span><br><span class="line">1:25:08</span><br><span class="line">And if you are about to email a project status that has gotten quite long, use Summarize to bring out the key points,</span><br><span class="line">1:25:16</span><br><span class="line">and then add them as a TL;DR right at the top. In addition to Mail, you can access Writing Tools systemwide,</span><br><span class="line">1:25:23</span><br><span class="line">nearly everywhere you write, including third-party apps. Apple Intelligence also powers Smart Reply in Mail.</span><br><span class="line">1:25:31</span><br><span class="line">For example, when you need to RSVP to an event, you will now see suggestions for your response based on the email.</span><br><span class="line">1:25:38</span><br><span class="line">If you say you&#x27;ll be there, Mail identifies questions you were asked in the invite, and offers intelligent selections</span><br><span class="line">1:25:44</span><br><span class="line">so you can quickly choose your responses. Your drafted response incorporates your answers.</span><br><span class="line">1:25:49</span><br><span class="line">So with just a few taps, you&#x27;re ready to send it off with all the right details. Finally, let&#x27;s talk about how Apple Intelligence</span><br><span class="line">1:25:57</span><br><span class="line">helps you stay on top of a busy inbox. We all deal with sorting through a ton of email every day.</span><br><span class="line">1:26:04</span><br><span class="line">And now it is easier and faster than ever to browse your inbox. Instead of previewing the first few lines of each email that don&#x27;t always convey</span><br><span class="line">1:26:12</span><br><span class="line">the most useful information, you can now see summaries, visible right from your email list.</span><br><span class="line">1:26:17</span><br><span class="line">So without even opening the email, you&#x27;ll know that your team is meeting on Thursday to discuss a new design.</span><br><span class="line">1:26:23</span><br><span class="line">And if you jump into a particularly long email when you&#x27;re in a hurry, you can tap to reveal a summary at the top of the email</span><br><span class="line">1:26:29</span><br><span class="line">and cut right to the chase. We&#x27;re also elevating Priority Messages.</span><br><span class="line">1:26:35</span><br><span class="line">Apple Intelligence can understand the content of the emails you receive, determine what&#x27;s most urgent, and surface it right at the top.</span><br><span class="line">1:26:43</span><br><span class="line">Like a dinner invite for tonight, or a boarding pass for your trip this afternoon. And deep understanding of language extends beyond your inbox into more places,</span><br><span class="line">1:26:54</span><br><span class="line">like your Notifications. First, just like in Mail, your Priority Notifications appear at the top of the stack, letting you know what to pay attention to at a glance.</span><br><span class="line">1:27:03</span><br><span class="line">And to make scanning your notifications faster, they&#x27;re summarized. So when the group chat is blowing up, you can quickly see</span><br><span class="line">1:27:11</span><br><span class="line">that Savita booked the house and Lia is arriving early, right from your Lock Screen. Apple Intelligence also enables an all-new Focus</span><br><span class="line">1:27:19</span><br><span class="line">called Reduce Interruptions. It understands the content of your notifications to selectively surface only the ones that might need</span><br><span class="line">1:27:27</span><br><span class="line">immediate attention, like a text about today&#x27;s daycare pickup. From catching up on Priority Notifications,</span><br><span class="line">1:27:33</span><br><span class="line">to staying present and focused with Reduce Interruptions, and refining your words with Writing Tools,</span><br><span class="line">1:27:38</span><br><span class="line">Apple Intelligence helps you save time in so many ways. Now, over to Cyrus to show you how it unlocks new ways to express yourself.</span><br><span class="line">1:27:48</span><br><span class="line">Cyrus Irani: Apple Intelligence enables you to create fun, original images whether you are sprucing up a Keynote for class</span><br><span class="line">1:27:55</span><br><span class="line">or trying to land an idea while collaborating in Freeform. And third-party apps can offer this experience too, like in Craft,</span><br><span class="line">1:28:02</span><br><span class="line">where you can create a delightful image to add to your document. Let&#x27;s take a closer look at how Apple Intelligence</span><br><span class="line">1:28:08</span><br><span class="line">helps you express yourself visually in Messages. One of the most fun ways to communicate in Messages is with emoji.</span><br><span class="line">1:28:16</span><br><span class="line">But even with thousands of emoji to choose from, there are times when you can&#x27;t quite find the right one for how you feel.</span><br><span class="line">1:28:23</span><br><span class="line">So we&#x27;re introducing Genmoji. Leveraging the power of Apple Intelligence,</span><br><span class="line">1:28:29</span><br><span class="line">you can create Genmoji, on-device, right in the Keyboard, and match any moment perfectly.</span><br><span class="line">1:28:36</span><br><span class="line">Just provide a description and you&#x27;ll see your Genmoji appear right before your eyes, along with more options to choose from.</span><br><span class="line">1:28:42</span><br><span class="line">This is great in those times when you&#x27;re updating a friend about your relaxing weekend, getting the group chat excited about brunch,</span><br><span class="line">1:28:49</span><br><span class="line">or complaining about the rowdy squirrel right outside your window. And because Apple Intelligence is aware of who&#x27;s in your photo library,</span><br><span class="line">1:28:57</span><br><span class="line">you can simply pick someone and create a Genmoji that looks just like them! These are perfect for sharing with friends as a sticker,</span><br><span class="line">1:29:04</span><br><span class="line">reacting to messages with a Tapback, and you can even add Genmoji inline in your messages!</span><br><span class="line">1:29:10</span><br><span class="line">Let your imagination run wild as you create just the right Genmoji!</span><br><span class="line">1:29:16</span><br><span class="line">And because it&#x27;s so much fun to use images to express ourselves, we went even further with a new system experience</span><br><span class="line">1:29:22</span><br><span class="line">we call Image Playground. This is a new way to create playful images in just seconds.</span><br><span class="line">1:29:29</span><br><span class="line">It&#x27;s so easy to use, and we&#x27;ve built it right into apps like Messages. To get started, you can choose from a range of concepts</span><br><span class="line">1:29:37</span><br><span class="line">like themes, costumes, accessories, places, and more.</span><br><span class="line">1:29:45</span><br><span class="line">When you select them, they get added to your playground. No need to engineer the perfect prompt.</span><br><span class="line">1:29:51</span><br><span class="line">In a few seconds, you&#x27;ll see Apple Intelligence creates a preview of what your image could look like.</span><br><span class="line">1:29:57</span><br><span class="line">A moment later, you&#x27;ll see more previews you can swipe through. This all happens on-device!</span><br><span class="line">1:30:03</span><br><span class="line">So you have the freedom to experiment and create as many images as you want. This is great for quickly responding to your friends with just the right image.</span><br><span class="line">1:30:12</span><br><span class="line">When you have a really specific idea in mind, you can just type a description to add it to your playground.</span><br><span class="line">1:30:20</span><br><span class="line">And you can easily adjust which style you want to use</span><br><span class="line">1:30:25</span><br><span class="line">and choose from Animation, Sketch, or Illustration.</span><br><span class="line">1:30:32</span><br><span class="line">Whichever suits the vibe of your conversation.

It&#x27;s that simple. Since Apple Intelligence understands your personal context,</span><br><span class="line">1:30:45</span><br><span class="line">you&#x27;ll see suggestions for concepts related to your Messages conversation, including you and people from your Messages thread.</span><br><span class="line">1:30:52</span><br><span class="line">When selected, it uses appearances from Photos to add you, or one of them, to the image you&#x27;re creating.</span><br><span class="line">1:30:59</span><br><span class="line">♪ ♪</span><br><span class="line">1:31:09</span><br><span class="line">With an intuitive experience to create totally original images, and so many ways to express what you want,</span><br><span class="line">1:31:16</span><br><span class="line">the Image Playground is going to make everyday conversations a whole lot more fun.</span><br><span class="line">1:31:22</span><br><span class="line">In addition to Messages, this experience is also available in apps like Keynote, Pages, and Freeform.</span><br><span class="line">1:31:30</span><br><span class="line">To make it easy to experiment with creating images, we&#x27;ve also built a dedicated Image Playground app.</span><br><span class="line">1:31:36</span><br><span class="line">You can use it to try out Styles, play around with different concepts, and make something to share with friends in other apps or on social media.</span><br><span class="line">1:31:43</span><br><span class="line">And for Developers, they can integrate the new Image Playground experience in their app too, with a new API.</span><br><span class="line">1:31:51</span><br><span class="line">With the Image Playground experience and Genmoji, you can create fun and delightful images right where you need them.</span><br><span class="line">1:31:58</span><br><span class="line">Now, here&#x27;s Seb to show you more experiences enabled by the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence.</span><br><span class="line">1:32:06</span><br><span class="line">Sebastien Marineau-Mes: With the ability to deeply understand and create images, Apple Intelligence unlocks some fantastic new experiences.</span><br><span class="line">1:32:14</span><br><span class="line">Like a brand-new tool in the Notes app that we call Image Wand. Image Wand can transform a rough sketch into a polished image</span><br><span class="line">1:32:22</span><br><span class="line">that complements your notes and makes them more visual. And it&#x27;s available right in your tool palette.</span><br><span class="line">1:32:28</span><br><span class="line">Suppose you want a better image for your architectural history course. With Image Wand, you can circle your rough sketch</span><br><span class="line">1:32:34</span><br><span class="line">using Apple Pencil to open up an Image Playground within your note. Image Wand uses on-device intelligence to analyze your sketch and words</span><br><span class="line">1:32:43</span><br><span class="line">and creates an image for you. What&#x27;s really fun is that you can even circle empty space,</span><br><span class="line">1:32:50</span><br><span class="line">and it will pull out context from the surrounding area to suggest the ideal image to go with your note.</span><br><span class="line">1:32:56</span><br><span class="line">It has never been easier to make your notes more visual and engaging.</span><br><span class="line">1:33:01</span><br><span class="line">Apple Intelligence also helps us make the most out of our ever-growing photo libraries. First, we have an update to photo editing.</span><br><span class="line">1:33:10</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;ve all had that time when we thought we got the perfect shot, then realized later it wasn&#x27;t quite perfect.</span><br><span class="line">1:33:16</span><br><span class="line">Now, the new Clean Up tool will identify distracting objects in the background, so you can make them disappear,</span><br><span class="line">1:33:22</span><br><span class="line">without accidentally changing your subject. Plus, searching for photos and videos is much more convenient,</span><br><span class="line">1:33:30</span><br><span class="line">because you can now use natural language phrases. So you can search for really specific things,</span><br><span class="line">1:33:35</span><br><span class="line">like &quot;Maya skateboarding in a tie-dye shirt,&quot; or &quot;Katie with stickers on her face.&quot;</span><br><span class="line">1:33:41</span><br><span class="line">Search in videos is also more powerful, with the ability to find a particular moment in the middle of a video clip.</span><br><span class="line">1:33:48</span><br><span class="line">So you can go right to the relevant segment when you search for that video of Maria cartwheeling on the grass.</span><br><span class="line">1:33:56</span><br><span class="line">Apple Intelligence also makes it so much more delightful to create a Memory Movie.</span><br><span class="line">1:34:02</span><br><span class="line">Today, when you want to use your photos and videos to create a movie yourself, like for your fishing trips with your kids,</span><br><span class="line">1:34:08</span><br><span class="line">it can take hours of work. You have to search through tons of photos to pick out the best ones,</span><br><span class="line">1:34:14</span><br><span class="line">figure out how to arrange them, and hunt for the right music. Now, thanks to Apple Intelligence, it is super easy</span><br><span class="line">1:34:22</span><br><span class="line">to create a memory about the story you want to see. Just type a description, and it can interpret that &quot;learning to fish&quot;</span><br><span class="line">1:34:29</span><br><span class="line">involves things like water, docks, fishing rods, and boats. Using its language and image understanding,</span><br><span class="line">1:34:36</span><br><span class="line">Apple Intelligence picks out the best photos and videos. And then it crafts a storyline with unique chapters</span><br><span class="line">1:34:43</span><br><span class="line">that are based on themes identified from your photos, and arranges them into a movie with its own narrative arc.</span><br><span class="line">1:34:49</span><br><span class="line">So now I can watch a wonderful Memory that starts with my son practicing on the dock, transitions to fishing on the boat,</span><br><span class="line">1:34:58</span><br><span class="line">and finishes with us holding the prize catch. And all of this is set to the perfect song selected from Apple Music.</span><br><span class="line">1:35:06</span><br><span class="line">Like all of Apple Intelligence, these updates to Photos are built on a foundation of privacy, so your photos and videos</span><br><span class="line">1:35:13</span><br><span class="line">are not shared with Apple, or anyone else. With endless possibilities, it is so much fun trying out</span><br><span class="line">1:35:20</span><br><span class="line">different ideas and revisiting our most precious moments. And now, back to Craig.</span><br><span class="line">1:35:29</span><br><span class="line">Craig: Apple Intelligence is truly unique in how it understands you and meets you where you are.</span><br><span class="line">1:35:35</span><br><span class="line">And what you saw here is just the beginning. It enables so many more helpful features.</span><br><span class="line">1:35:40</span><br><span class="line">For example, in the Notes app, you can now record and transcribe audio, to capture detailed notes while staying present in the moment.</span><br><span class="line">1:35:48</span><br><span class="line">And when your recording is finished, Apple Intelligence generates a summary to help you recall the key points at a glance.</span><br><span class="line">1:35:55</span><br><span class="line">Recordings, transcriptions, and Apple Intelligence-powered summaries are also coming to the Phone app.</span><br><span class="line">1:36:02</span><br><span class="line">And when you start a recording in a live call, participants are automatically notified, so no one is surprised.</span><br><span class="line">1:36:08</span><br><span class="line">Apple Intelligence is available for free with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia,</span><br><span class="line">1:36:15</span><br><span class="line">bringing you personal intelligence across the products you use every day.</span><br><span class="line">1:36:20</span><br><span class="line">Still, there are other artificial intelligence tools available that can be useful for tasks that draw on broad world knowledge,</span><br><span class="line">1:36:27</span><br><span class="line">or offer specialized domain expertise. We want you to be able to use these external models</span><br><span class="line">1:36:32</span><br><span class="line">without having to jump between different tools. So we&#x27;re integrating them right into your experiences.</span><br><span class="line">1:36:38</span><br><span class="line">And we&#x27;re starting out with the best of these, the pioneer and market leader ChatGPT from Open AI,</span><br><span class="line">1:36:46</span><br><span class="line">powered by GPT-4o. First, we built support into Siri, so Siri can tap into ChatGPT&#x27;s expertise</span><br><span class="line">1:36:54</span><br><span class="line">when it might be helpful for you. For example, if you need menu ideas for an elaborate meal to make for friends</span><br><span class="line">1:37:00</span><br><span class="line">using some freshly caught fish and ingredients from your garden, you can just ask Siri. Siri determines that ChatGPT might have good ideas for this,</span><br><span class="line">1:37:09</span><br><span class="line">asks your permission to share your question, and presents the answer directly. You can also include photos with your questions.</span><br><span class="line">1:37:16</span><br><span class="line">If you want some advice on decorating, you can take a picture and ask, &quot;What kind of plants would go well on this deck?&quot;</span><br><span class="line">1:37:23</span><br><span class="line">Siri confirms if it&#x27;s okay to share your photo with ChatGPT and brings back relevant suggestions.</span><br><span class="line">1:37:28</span><br><span class="line">It&#x27;s a seamless integration. In addition to photos, you can also ask questions related to your documents, presentations, or PDFs.</span><br><span class="line">1:37:36</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;ve also integrated ChatGPT into the systemwide Writing Tools with Compose.</span><br><span class="line">1:37:42</span><br><span class="line">You can create content with ChatGPT for whatever you&#x27;re writing about. Suppose you want to create a custom bedtime story</span><br><span class="line">1:37:48</span><br><span class="line">for your six-year-old who loves butterflies and solving riddles. Put in your initial idea and send it to ChatGPT</span><br><span class="line">1:37:55</span><br><span class="line">to get something back she&#x27;ll love. Compose can also help you tap into ChatGPT&#x27;s image capabilities</span><br><span class="line">1:38:02</span><br><span class="line">to generate images in a wide variety of styles to illustrate your bedtime story. You&#x27;ll be able to access ChatGPT for free and without creating an account.</span><br><span class="line">1:38:12</span><br><span class="line">Your requests and information will not be logged. And for ChatGPT subscribers, you&#x27;ll be able to connect your account</span><br><span class="line">1:38:20</span><br><span class="line">and access paid features right within our experiences. Of course, you&#x27;re in control over when ChatGPT is used</span><br><span class="line">1:38:27</span><br><span class="line">and will be asked before any of your information is shared. ChatGPT integration will be coming to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia</span><br><span class="line">1:38:36</span><br><span class="line">later this year. We also intend to add support for other AI models in the future.</span><br><span class="line">1:38:41</span><br><span class="line">Now, let&#x27;s talk about developers, and how they can integrate the experiences powered by Apple Intelligence into their apps.</span><br><span class="line">1:38:50</span><br><span class="line">We have updated our SDKs with new APIs and frameworks. For example, developers can add the Image Playground experience</span><br><span class="line">1:38:57</span><br><span class="line">to their app with just a few lines of code. This means that an app like Craft can help users create images</span><br><span class="line">1:39:03</span><br><span class="line">to make their documents much more visual. And Writing Tools are automatically available within apps that use the standard editable text view.</span><br><span class="line">1:39:11</span><br><span class="line">So without any development effort, an app like Bear Notes can automatically allow users to rewrite, proofread, and summarize notes.</span><br><span class="line">1:39:20</span><br><span class="line">Plus, we are building many more ways for users to take action in apps with Siri.</span><br><span class="line">1:39:26</span><br><span class="line">If a developer has already adopted SiriKit, they&#x27;ll see immediate enhancements from many of Siri&#x27;s new capabilities without additional work.</span><br><span class="line">1:39:34</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re also investing deeply in the App Intents framework to connect the vast world of apps with Apple Intelligence.</span><br><span class="line">1:39:41</span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re defining new intents across our operating systems and making them available to developers starting with these categories.</span><br><span class="line">1:39:49</span><br><span class="line">These intents are pre-defined, trained, and tested, so they&#x27;re easy for developers to adopt.</span><br><span class="line">1:39:55</span><br><span class="line">Using new App Intents, an app like Darkroom will be able to use the Apply Filter intent to give users the ability to say,</span><br><span class="line">1:40:02</span><br><span class="line">&quot;Apply a cinematic preset to the photo I took of Ian yesterday.&quot; These are just a handful of the updates coming to our platform SDKs</span><br><span class="line">1:40:09</span><br><span class="line">so developers can add intelligent and useful features to their apps. We will share more details in the Platforms State of the Union</span><br><span class="line">1:40:17</span><br><span class="line">later today, like how we are bringing generative intelligence to Xcode for developing apps using Swift and SwiftUI,</span><br><span class="line">1:40:24</span><br><span class="line">with features like on-device code completion, and smart assistance for Swift coding questions.</span><br><span class="line">1:40:30</span><br><span class="line">So that&#x27;s Apple Intelligence, with tremendous benefits for developers and users.</span><br><span class="line">1:40:37</span><br><span class="line">This is AI for the rest of us, personal intelligence you can rely on at work, home, and everywhere in between.</span><br><span class="line">1:40:45</span><br><span class="line">Apple Intelligence harnesses the power of our most advanced silicon, and will be available on iPhone 15 Pro, and iPad and Mac with M1 and later.</span><br><span class="line">1:40:55</span><br><span class="line">Apple Intelligence will be available to try out in US English this summer.</span><br><span class="line">1:41:00</span><br><span class="line">We are bringing it to users in beta as part of iOS 18, iPadOS 18,</span><br><span class="line">1:41:06</span><br><span class="line">and macOS Sequoia this fall, with some features and additional languages and platforms coming out</span><br><span class="line">1:41:11</span><br><span class="line">over the course of the next year. This is the beginning of an exciting new chapter of personal intelligence.</span><br><span class="line">1:41:18</span><br><span class="line">Intelligence built for your most personal products: your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</span><br><span class="line">1:41:25</span><br><span class="line">Intelligence grounded in the things that make you, you.

Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. It harnesses the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. With Private Cloud Compute, Apple sets a new standard for privacy in AI, with the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers.</span><br><span class="line">“We’re thrilled to introduce a new chapter in Apple innovation. Apple Intelligence will transform what users can do with our products — and what our products can do for our users,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Our unique approach combines generative AI with a user’s personal context to deliver truly helpful intelligence. And it can access that information in a completely private and secure way to help users do the things that matter most to them. This is AI as only Apple can deliver it, and we can’t wait for users to experience what it can do.”</span><br><span class="line">New Capabilities for Understanding and Creating Language</span><br><span class="line">Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools built into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.</span><br><span class="line">Whether tidying up class notes, ensuring a blog post reads just right, or making sure an email is perfectly crafted, Writing Tools help users feel more confident in their writing. With Rewrite, Apple Intelligence allows users to choose from different versions of what they have written, adjusting the tone to suit the audience and task at hand. From finessing a cover letter, to adding humor and creativity to a party invitation, Rewrite helps deliver the right words to meet the occasion. Proofread checks grammar, word choice, and sentence structure while also suggesting edits — along with explanations of the edits — that users can review or quickly accept. With Summarize, users can select text and have it recapped in the form of a digestible paragraph, bulleted key points, a table, or a list.</span><br><span class="line">A user opens the Writing Tools menu while working on an email, and is given the option to select Proofread or Rewrite.</span><br><span class="line">A user opens the Notes app and chooses the Summarize tool for their notes on holistic health.</span><br><span class="line">A user opens the Writing Tools menu while working on an email, and is given the option to select Proofread or Rewrite.</span><br><span class="line">With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools powered by Apple Intelligence, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write.</span><br><span class="line">previous</span><br><span class="line">next</span><br><span class="line">In Mail, staying on top of emails has never been easier. With Priority Messages, a new section at the top of the inbox shows the most urgent emails, like a same-day dinner invitation or boarding pass. Across a user’s inbox, instead of previewing the first few lines of each email, they can see summaries without needing to open a message. For long threads, users can view pertinent details with just a tap. Smart Reply provides suggestions for a quick response, and will identify questions in an email to ensure everything is answered.</span><br><span class="line">The Priority Messages feature is shown on iPhone 15 Pro.</span><br><span class="line">The email preview summary feature is shown on iPhone 15 Pro.</span><br><span class="line">The Smart Reply feature is shown on iPhone 15 Pro.</span><br><span class="line">The Priority Messages feature is shown on iPhone 15 Pro.</span><br><span class="line">With Priority Messages in Mail, a new section at the top of the inbox shows the most urgent emails.</span><br><span class="line">previous</span><br><span class="line">next</span><br><span class="line">Deep understanding of language also extends to Notifications. Priority Notifications appear at the top of the stack to surface what’s most important, and summaries help users scan long or stacked notifications to show key details right on the Lock Screen, such as when a group chat is particularly active. And to help users stay present in what they’re doing, Reduce Interruptions is a new Focus that surfaces only the notifications that might need immediate attention, like a text about an early pickup from daycare.</span><br><span class="line">Priority Notifications are shown on iPhone 15 Pro.</span><br><span class="line">The new Reduce Interruptions Focus is shown on iPhone 15 Pro.</span><br><span class="line">Priority Notifications are shown on iPhone 15 Pro.</span><br><span class="line">Priority Notifications surface what’s most important, and summaries help users scan long or stacked notifications to show key details right on the Lock Screen.</span><br><span class="line">previous</span><br><span class="line">next</span><br><span class="line">In the Notes and Phone apps, users can now record, transcribe, and summarize audio.

By simply typing a description, their Genmoji appears, along with additional options. Users can even create Genmoji of friends and family based on their photos. Just like emoji, Genmoji can be added inline to messages, or shared as a sticker or reaction in a Tapback.</span><br><span class="line">A user selects Genmoji options based on the prompt, “Smiley relaxing wearing cucumbers.”</span><br><span class="line">A user selects Genmoji options based on the prompt, “Smiley relaxing wearing cucumbers.”</span><br><span class="line">In Messages, a user is presented with an array of Genmoji options to use as a Tapback.</span><br><span class="line">In Messages, a user is presented with an array of Genmoji options to use as a Tapback.</span><br><span class="line">A user selects Genmoji options based on the prompt, “Smiley relaxing wearing cucumbers.”</span><br><span class="line">By simply typing a description, a Genmoji appears, along with additional options.</span><br><span class="line">previous</span><br><span class="line">next</span><br><span class="line">New Features in Photos Give Users More Control</span><br><span class="line">Searching for photos and videos becomes even more convenient with Apple Intelligence. Natural language can be used to search for specific photos, such as “Maya skateboarding in a tie-dye shirt,” or “Katie with stickers on her face.” Search in videos also becomes more powerful with the ability to find specific moments in clips so users can go right to the relevant segment. Additionally, the new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject.</span><br><span class="line">Pause playback of video: Photos Clean Up Tool</span><br><span class="line">The new Clean Up tool in Photos can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject.</span><br><span class="line">With Memories, users can create the story they want to see by simply typing a description. Using language and image understanding, Apple Intelligence will pick out the best photos and videos based on the description, craft a storyline with chapters based on themes identified from the photos, and arrange them into a movie with its own narrative arc. Users will even get song suggestions to match their memory from Apple Music. As with all Apple Intelligence features, user photos and videos are kept private on device and are not shared with Apple or anyone else.</span><br><span class="line">Three iPhone 15 Pro screens show how users can create Memory Movies.</span><br><span class="line">With Memories, Apple Intelligence can pick out the best photos and videos based on a user’s description, craft a storyline, and arrange it all into a movie with its own narrative arc.</span><br><span class="line">Siri Enters a New Era</span><br><span class="line">Powered by Apple Intelligence, Siri becomes more deeply integrated into the system experience. With richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri is more natural, more contextually relevant, and more personal, with the ability to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. It can follow along if users stumble over words and maintain context from one request to the next. Additionally, users can type to Siri, and switch between text and voice to communicate with Siri in whatever way feels right for the moment. Siri also has a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when Siri is active.</span><br><span class="line">A user types to Siri on iPhone 15 Pro.</span><br><span class="line">Now users can type to Siri, and switch between text and voice to communicate with Siri in whatever way feels right for the moment.</span><br><span class="line">Siri can now give users device support everywhere they go, and answer thousands of questions about how to do something on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Users can learn everything from how to schedule an email in the Mail app, to how to switch from Light to Dark Mode.</span><br><span class="line">On iPhone 15 Pro, Siri answers a user’s question about scheduling a text message.</span><br><span class="line">With onscreen awareness, Siri makes it easy to perform an action related to information on the screen, such as adding an address received in Messages to a friend’s contact card.</span><br><span class="line">With onscreen awareness, Siri will be able to understand and take action with users’ content in more apps over time. For example, if a friend texts a user their new address in Messages, the receiver can say, “Add this address to his contact card.”</span><br><span class="line">Pause playback of video: Siri Adding an Address to Contact Card</span><br><span class="line">Siri can now take hundreds of new actions in and across apps, including finding book recommendations sent by a friend in Messages and Mail.</span><br><span class="line">With Apple Intelligence, Siri will be able to take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps. For example, a user could say, “Bring up that article about cicadas from my Reading List,” or “Send the photos from the barbecue on Saturday to Malia,” and Siri will take care of it.</span><br><span class="line">Siri finds a friend’s book recommendations for an iPhone 15 Pro user.</span><br><span class="line">Siri can now take hundreds of new actions in and across apps, including finding book recommendations sent by a friend in Messages and Mail.</span><br><span class="line">Siri will be able to deliver intelligence that’s tailored to the user and their on-device information. For example, a user can say, “Play that podcast that Jamie recommended,” and Siri will locate and play the episode, without the user having to remember whether it was mentioned in a text or an email. Or they could ask, “When is Mom’s flight landing?” and Siri will find the flight details and cross-reference them with real-time flight tracking to give an arrival time.</span><br><span class="line">Pause playback of video: Siri Intelligence Based on On-Device Information</span><br><span class="line">Siri is able to deliver intelligence that’s tailored to the user and their on-device information, like locating details on an upcoming flight or keeping track of a dinner reservation.</span><br><span class="line">A New Standard for Privacy in AI</span><br><span class="line">To be truly helpful, Apple Intelligence relies on understanding deep personal context while also protecting user privacy.
