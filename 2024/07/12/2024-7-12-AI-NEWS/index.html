class="line"></span><br><span class="line">by Jay Shah, Ganesh Bikshandi, Ying Zhang, Vijay Thakkar, Pradeep Ramani, Tri Dao</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Attention, as a core layer of the ubiquitous Transformer architecture, is a bottleneck for large language models and long-context applications. FlashAttention (and FlashAttention-2) pioneered an approach to speed up attention on GPUs by minimizing memory reads/writes, and is now used by most libraries to accelerate Transformer training and inference. This has contributed to a massive increase in LLM context length in the last two years, from 2-4K (GPT-3, OPT) to 128K (GPT-4), or even 1M (Llama 3). However, despite its success, FlashAttention has yet to take advantage of new capabilities in modern hardware, with FlashAttention-2 achieving only 35% utilization of theoretical max FLOPs on the H100 GPU. In this blogpost, we describe three main techniques to speed up attention on Hopper GPUs: exploiting asynchrony of the Tensor Cores and TMA to (1) overlap overall computation and data movement via warp-specialization and (2) interleave block-wise matmul and softmax operations, and (3) incoherent processing that leverages hardware support for FP8 low-precision.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">We’re excited to release FlashAttention-3 that incorporates these techniques. It’s 1.5-2.0x faster than FlashAttention-2 with FP16, up to 740 TFLOPS, i.e., 75% utilization of H100 theoretical max FLOPS. With FP8, FlashAttention-3 reaches close to 1.2 PFLOPS, with 2.6x smaller error than baseline FP8 attention.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">FlashAttention-3 is available at: https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention</span><br><span class="line">Paper</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">FLASHATTENTION RECAP</span><br><span class="line">FlashAttention is an algorithm that reorders the attention computation and leverages tiling and recomputation to significantly speed it up and reduce memory usage from quadratic to linear in sequence length. We use tiling to load blocks of inputs from HBM (GPU memory) to SRAM (fast cache), perform attention with respect to that block, and update the output in HBM. By not writing the large intermediate attention matrices to HBM, we reduce the amount of memory reads/writes, which brings 2-4x wallclock time speedup.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Here we show a diagram of FlashAttention forward pass: with tiling and softmax rescaling, we operate by blocks and avoid having to read/write from HBM, while obtaining the correct output with no approximation.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">math equations</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">NEW HARDWARE FEATURES ON HOPPER GPUS - WGMMA, TMA, FP8</span><br><span class="line">While FlashAttention-2 can achieve up to 70% theoretical max FLOPS on Ampere (A100) GPUs, it does not yet take advantage of new features on Hopper GPUs to maximize performance. We describe some of the new Hopper-specific features here, and why they are important.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">1. WGMMA (Warpgroup Matrix Multiply-Accumulate). This new feature makes use of the new Tensor Cores on Hopper, with much higher throughput1 than the older mma.sync instruction in Ampere (image from the H100 white paper).</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">image from the H100 white paper</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">2. TMA (Tensor Memory Accelerator). This is a special hardware unit that accelerates the transfer of data between global memory and shared memory, taking care of all index calculation and out-of-bound predication. This frees up registers, which is a valuable resource to increase tile size and efficiency.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">block diagram</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">3. Low-precision with FP8. This doubles the Tensor Core throughput (e.g. 989 TFLOPS with FP16 and 1978 TFLOPS with FP8), but trades off accuracy by using fewer bits to represent floating point numbers.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">6x throughput</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">FlashAttention-3 makes use of all of these new features of Hopper, using powerful abstractions from NVIDIA’s CUTLASS library.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">By rewriting FlashAttention to use these new features, we can already significantly speed it up (e.g., from 350 TFLOPS in FlashAttention-2 FP16 forward pass to around 540-570 TFLOPS). However, the asynchronous nature of the new instructions on Hopper (WGMMA and TMA) opens up additional algorithmic opportunities to overlap operations and thereby extract even greater performance. For this blogpost, we’ll explain two such techniques specific to attention. The generic technique of warp specialization, with separate producer and consumer warps doing TMA and WGMMA, is well-covered elsewhere in the context of GEMM and works the same here.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">ASYNCHRONY: OVERLAPPING GEMM AND SOFTMAX</span><br><span class="line">Why overlap?</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Attention has GEMMs (those matmuls between Q and K and between attention probability P and V) and softmax as its two main operations. Why do we need to overlap them? Isn’t most of the FLOPS in the GEMMs anyway? As long as the GEMMs are fast (e.g., computed using WGMMA instructions), shouldn’t the GPU be going brrrr?</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">The problem is that non-matmul operations are much slower than matmul operations on modern accelerators. Special functions such as exponential (for the softmax) have even lower throughput than floating point multiply-add; they are evaluated by the multi-function unit, a unit separate from floating point multiply-add or matrix multiply-add. As an example, the H100 GPU SXM5 has 989 TFLOPS of FP16 matrix multiply, but only 3.9 TFLOPS (256x less throughput) for special functions2! For head dimension 128, there are 512x more matmul FLOPS than exponential, which means that exponential can take 50% of the time compared to matmul. The situation is even worse for FP8, where the matmul FLOPS are twice as fast yet exponential FLOPS stay the same speed. Ideally we want matmul and softmax to operate in parallel. While the Tensor Cores are busy with matmul, the multi-function units should be calculating exponential!</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Inter-warpgroup overlapping with pingpong scheduling</span><br><span class="line">The first and easiest way to overlap GEMM and softmax is to do nothing at all! The warp schedulers already try to schedule warps so that if some warps are blocked (e.g., waiting for GEMM results), other warps can run. That is, the warp schedulers do some of this overlapping for us, for free.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">However, we can improve on this by doing some of the scheduling manually. As an example, if we have 2 warpgroups (labeled 1 and 2 – each warpgroup is a group of 4 warps), we can use synchronization barriers (bar.sync) so that warpgroup 1 first does its GEMMs (e.g., GEMM1 of one iteration and GEMM0 of the next iteration), and then warpgroup 2 does its GEMMs while warpgroup 1 does its softmax, and so on. This “pingpong” schedule is illustrated in the figure below, where the same color denotes the same iteration.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">block chart</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">This would allow us to perform the softmax in the shadow of the GEMMs of the other warpgroup. Of course, this figure is just a caricature; in practice the scheduling is not really this clean. Nevertheless, pingpong scheduling can improve FP16 attention forward pass from around 570 TFLOPS to 620 TFLOPS (head dim 128, seqlen 8K).</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Intra-warpgroup overlapping of GEMM and Softmax</span><br><span class="line">Even within one warpgroup, we can have some part of softmax running while the GEMMs of that warpgroup is running. This is illustrated in this figure, where the same color denotes the same iteration.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">block chart</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">This pipelining increases throughput from around 620 TFLOPS to around 640-660 TFLOPS for FP16 attention forward, at the cost of higher register pressure. We need more registers to hold both accumulators of the GEMMs, and the input/output of softmax. Overall, we find this technique to offer a favorable tradeoff.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">LOW-PRECISION: REDUCE QUANTIZATION ERROR WITH INCOHERENT PROCESSING</span><br><span class="line">LLM activation can have outliers with much larger magnitude than the rest of the features. These outliers make it difficult to quantize, producing much larger quantization errors. We leverage incoherent processing, a technique used in the quantization literature (e.g. from QuIP) that multiplies the query and key with a random orthogonal matrix to “spread out” the outliers and reduce quantization error. In particular, we use the Hadamard transform (with random signs), which can be done per attention head in O(d log d) instead of O(d^2) time, where d is the head dimension. Since the Hadamard transform is memory-bandwidth bound, it can be fused with previous operations such as rotary embedding (also memory-bandwidth bound) “for free”.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">In our experiment where Q, K, V are generated from a standard normal distribution but 0.1% of the entries have large magnitudes (to simulate outliers), we found that incoherent processing can reduce the quantization error by 2.6x. We show numerical error comparison in the table below. Please see the paper for details.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">text diagram</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">ATTENTION BENCHMARK</span><br><span class="line">We show some results with FlashAttention-3, and compare it to FlashAttention-2, as well as the implementation in Triton and cuDNN (both of which already use new hardware features of Hopper GPUs).</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">For FP16, we see about 1.6x-1.8x speedup over FlashAttention-2</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">speed charts</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">speed charts</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">For FP8, we can reach close to 1.2 PFLOPS!</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">speed charts</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">DISCUSSION</span><br><span class="line">This blogpost highlights some of the optimizations for FlashAttention available on Hopper GPUs.

Despite several successful use cases, researchers also raised concerns around model collapse and drawbacks of imitating other models. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that synthetic data varies in quality and diversity. Effective use of synthetic data usually requires significant human effort in curating the data. We focus on using synthetic data for post-training, specifically creating data by powerful models to teach a new skill or behavior to another model, we refer to this setting as Generative Teaching. We introduce AgentInstruct, an extensible agentic framework for automatically creating large amounts of diverse and high-quality synthetic data. AgentInstruct can create both the prompts and responses, using only raw data sources like text documents and code files as seeds. We demonstrate the utility of AgentInstruct by creating a post training dataset of 25M pairs to teach language models different skills, such as text editing, creative writing, tool usage, coding, reading comprehension, etc. The dataset can be used for instruction tuning of any base model. We post-train Mistral-7b with the data. When comparing the resulting model Orca-3 to Mistral-7b-Instruct (which uses the same base model), we observe significant improvements across many benchmarks. For example, 40% improvement on AGIEval, 19% improvement on MMLU, 54% improvement on GSM8K, 38% improvement on BBH and 45% improvement on AlpacaEval. Additionally, it consistently outperforms other models such as LLAMA-8B-instruct and GPT-3.5-turbo.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">###</span><br><span class="line">https://openai.com/index/openai-and-los-alamos-national-laboratory-work-together/</span><br><span class="line">July 10, 2024</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">OpenAI and Los Alamos National Laboratory announce bioscience research partnership</span><br><span class="line">OpenAI and Los Alamos National Laboratory are developing evaluations to understand how multimodal AI models can be used safely by scientists in laboratory settings.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">LosAlamos OpenAI</span><br><span class="line">OpenAI and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) – one of the United States’ leading national laboratories – are working together to study how artificial intelligence can be used safely by scientists in laboratory settings to advance bioscientific research.

This includes biological safety evaluations for GPT-4o and its currently unreleased real-time voice systems to understand how they could be used to support research in bioscience. We believe our upcoming evaluation will be the first of its kind and contribute to state-of-the-art research on AI biosecurity evaluations.

Tasks may include transformation (e.g., introducing foreign genetic material into a host organism; cell culture (e.g., maintaining and propagating cells in vitro), and cell separation (e.g., through centrifugation).

This paper introduces an RLAIF framework for improving the code generation abilities of lightweight (&lt;1B parameters) LLMs. We specifically focus on code generation tasks that require writing appropriate API calls, which is challenging due to the well-known issue of hallucination in LLMs. Our framework extracts AI feedback from a larger LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) through a specialized prompting strategy and uses this data to train a reward model towards better alignment from smaller LLMs. We run our experiments on the Gorilla dataset and meticulously assess the quality of the model-generated code across various metrics, including AST, ROUGE, and Code-BLEU, and develop a pipeline to compute its executability rate accurately. Our approach significantly enhances the fine-tuned LLM baseline&#x27;s performance, achieving a 4.5% improvement in executability rate.

The token gets appended to the current text, and the decoder compute logits again, and the cycle continues.</span><br><span class="line">The authors of DoLa wanted to improve that simple method.</span><br><span class="line">They knew this established fact that transformer LMs encode low-level info (like base syntax) in early layers and more high-level info like knowledge in the later layers.</span><br><span class="line">💡 This gave them their key idea: During decoding, rather than picking the token with the highest logit, 𝘄𝗵𝘆 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗽𝗶𝗰𝗸 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘀𝘀 𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝘀?</span><br><span class="line">Implementation is actually quite simple: at each step, you get the layer for which the logits diverge most from your final layer, and this chosen layer becomes the premature layer. Then you subtract the logits from the premature layer to your final layer, in order to reward tokens for which the logits progressed most. And this lets you pick your next token.</span><br><span class="line">Their test settings:</span><br><span class="line">➤ Test 4 sizes of Llama-1 models (7b to 65B)</span><br><span class="line">➤ Benchmarks on multiple choice QA (TruthfulQA, FACTOR) and open-ended QA (TruthfulQA-open-ended, GSM8K)</span><br><span class="line">✨ 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗹𝘆 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲!</span><br><span class="line">🚀 𝟱% - 𝟮𝟬% 𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘀𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝘀</span><br><span class="line">🚀 For instance on TruthfulQA / Open-ended, across all model sizes the increase in truthfulness is 14 base points, which is 𝗮𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝟰𝟬% 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴!</span><br><span class="line">🤔 Wouldn&#x27;t decoding take longer because of this added contrasting step? 👉 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝗴𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲, 𝟭 𝘁𝗼 𝟴% 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆.</span><br><span class="line">The paper has additional insights such as how token confidence evolves across layers for different types of tokens: I recommend to read it!</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
